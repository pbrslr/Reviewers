ABSTRACT: Assessing and predicting the thermal conductivity (κ) of macroporous materials is particularly important for additive manufactured 3D structures, as they offer considerable potential for tuning architectures and properties. In this work, finite element methods (FEM) are used to simulate the transient plane source test in 3D logpile lattices, approaching the effect of interfacial thermal contact resistances on κ measurement. Besides, the influence of different geometrical parameters (rod diameter, macropore size and overlapping between rods in consecutive layers) and the κ of the strut material on the anisotropic thermal conductivity of 3D lattices are investigated. The models are validated using experimental data for 3D composite structures of γ-Al2O3 with graphene nanoplatelet contents up to 18 vol%, as well as with reported data for alike scaffolds, all printed by robocasting. Results have strong impact for the application of novel 3D structures in energy production and storage, catalysis and heat transfer-related fields. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The demand for hydrogen has extraordinarily grown during the last years, being one of the most attractive forms of fuels to produce green energy. Cubic zirconia ceramics are considered promising catalytic supports, and the additive manufacturing of porous 3D structures based on these ceramics could enhance their catalytic performance. Herein, lightweight highly porous (up to 88%) 3D patterned 8 mol% yttria-stabilized cubic zirconia (8YSZ) scaffolds are manufactured by robocasting from pseudoplastic aqueous-based inks to produce catalytic supports for the hydrogen (H2) production. These scaffolds are thermally treated at temperatures ranging between 1000 and 1400 °C and, hence, mechanically and electrically characterized. 3D 8YSZ structures sintered at 1200 °C, with an appropriate balance between high porosity (86%) and compressive strength (3.7 MPa), are impregnated with palladium (Pd) catalytic nanoparticles and employed in the catalytic dehydrogenation of renewable formic acid (FA) using a fixed-bed reactor. 3D Pd/8YSZ catalyst leads to the continuous production of CO-free H2 with a FA conversion of 32% at T = 55 °C. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Porous cordierite materials are 3D printed by robocasting from two kaolin containing raw materials mixtures. Water suspensions of both mixtures at variable solid concentrations (40–67 wt%) are characterized by rheological measurements, showing good printability for concentrations &gt;60 wt% without the need of any printing additive. The mixtures react during sintering (at 1250 °C) giving indialite as the main phase in the structures, which differ in minor phases. Three types of lattices are printed for both compositions with a logpile inner structure. Properties of interest like the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), the thermal conductivity (KT) and the compression strength (σ) of the printed cordierites are determined and compared with published data. Results evidence that printing of clay containing reactive mixtures is a straightforward and cost-effective way to achieve porous complex shaped cordierite with CTE∼ 2–3 x10−6 K-1, KT ∼ 0.4–0.6 W m−1 K−1 and maximum σ of 24 MPa. © 2022 The Author(s)

ABSTRACT: One of the main drawbacks of phase change materials (PCM) to be employed as thermal energy storage (TES) systems in energy applications, such as concentrated solar power (CSP), is the liquid leakage, which considerably reduces the storage efficiency. To overcome this issue, a novel approach is presented, which is based on the development of three-dimensional (3D) engineered TES structures (3DTES) formed by highly porous patterned 3D printed low-cost clay supports (up to ~85% of total porosity) that are infiltrated with a molten sodium nitrate salt. Expanded vermiculite supports are additive manufactured by robocasting, a direct ink writing technology, using clay aqueous inks with a pseudoplastic behavior. 3DTES are lightweight (~1.8 g·cm−3), easy to handle, mechanically robust (~68 MPa) and exhibit high PCM encapsulation capacity (~78%), avoiding the molten salt leakage. Furthermore, they present an enthalpy of fusion of ~136 J·g−1, excellent thermal stability, and high thermal energy storage efficiency (~80%) and thermal conductivity (1.27 W·m−1·K−1), which is indicative of a great charging-discharging ability. The results open new opportunities through the 3DTES approach to manufacture promising affordable materials with outstanding performance for CSP applications. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: One of the main challenges to widen the potential applications of 3D printed highly porous ceramic structures in catalysis, energy storage or thermal management resides in the improvement of both their mechanical resistance and thermal conductivity. To achieve these goals, highly hierarchical γ-alumina (γ-Al2O3) scaffolds containing up to 18 vol% of graphene nanoplatelets (GNP), including channels of controlled size and shape in the millimeter scale and meso-porosity within the rods, are developed by robocasting from boehmite-based aqueous inks without other printing additives. These 3D structures exhibit high porosity (85%) and specific surface area of 100 m2 g−1. The incorporation of 12 vol% GNP leads to an enhanced mechanical response of the scaffolds, increasing the compressive strength and the elastic modulus up to ≈80% as compared with data for plain γ-Al2O3 scaffolds. The thermal conductivity is measured by the transient plane source method using specifically designed 3D structures with external sidewalls and additional top/bottom covers to assure a good contact at the outer surfaces. The thermal conductivity of 3D porous structures augments with the GNP content, reaching a maximum value four times higher for the scaffolds containing 18 vol% GNP than that attained for the 3D monolithic γ-Al2O3. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The application of structured reactors provides a number of advantages in chemical processes. In this paper, two different three-dimensional (3D) Fe/SiC catalysts with a square cell geometry have been manufactured by Robocasting: monoliths (D = 14 and H = 15 mm) and meshes (D = 24 and H = 2 mm) and studied in the catalytic phenol oxidation by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for the sustainable production of dihydroxybenzenes (DHBZ). The fluid dynamics, catalytic performance, reaction rates, external mass transport limitation, and catalyst stability have been compared in three different reactors, monolithic fixed-bed reactor, multimesh fixed-bed reactor, and monolithic stirrer reactor, at selected operating conditions. The results show that the mechanical stirring of the 3D Fe/SiC monoliths avoids the external mass transfer limitation caused by the presence of oxygen bubbles in the channels (produced from the HOx· species in autoscavenging radical reactions). In addition, the backmixing has a positive effect on the efficient consumption of H2O2but an adverse effect on the phenol selectivity to DHBZ since they are overoxidized to tar products at longer contact times. On the other hand, the wall porosity, and not the backmixing, affects the susceptibility of the 3D Fe/SiC catalyst to the Fe leaching, as occurs in the mesh structures. In conclusion, the monoliths operating under plug-flow and external mass transfer limitation in the monolithic fixed-bed reactor (MFB) provide an outstanding phenol selectivity to DHBZ and catalyst stability. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this work is to evaluate the performance of the stirring 3D Fe/Al2O3 monolithic reactor in batch operation applied to the liquid-phase hydroxylation of phenol by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2 ). An experimental and numerical investigation was carried out at the following operating conditions: CPHENOL,0 = 0.33 M, CH2O2,0 = 0.33 M, T = 75–95◦C, P = 1 atm, ω = 200–500 rpm and WCAT ~ 1.1 g. The kinetic model described the consumption of the H2O2 by a zero-order power-law equation, while the phenol hydroxylation and catechol and hydroquinone production by Eley–Rideal model; the rate determining step was the reaction between the adsorbed H2O2, phenol in solution with two active sites involved. The 3D CFD model, coupling the conservation of mass, momentum and species together with the reaction kinetic equations, was experimentally validated. It demonstrated a laminar flow characterized by the presence of an annular zone located inside and surrounding the monoliths (u = 40–80 mm s−1 ) and a central vortex with very low velocities (u = 3.5–8 mm s−1 ). The simulation study showed the increasing phenol selectivity to dihydroxybenzenes by the reaction temperature, while the initial H2O2 concentration mainly affects the phenol conversion. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The chemical kinetics of phenol hydroxylation by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce dihydroxybenzenes was studied using a 3D printed monolithic reactor. The monoliths were manufactured by the Robocasting technique. They consisted on honeycomb-structured Fe/SiC nanoparticles (13.5 mm in diameter and 14.8 mm in length) with triangle cell geometry and staggered interconnected channels (71 cells per cm2). The isothermal reactor was constituted by three stacked monoliths and was operated as an ideal plug flow reactor, according to the measured residence time distribution. The hydroxylation experiments were carried out at CPHENOL,0 = 0.33 M, phenol:H2O2 molar ratio 1:1, τ(space time) = 0–254 g h L-1, T = 80, 85 and 90 °C and water as unique solvent. Experimental results showed no mass transfer limitations. The best fits were obtained for H2O2 decomposition with a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson kinetic model and for phenol hydroxylation, as well as, catechol and hydroquinone production, with an Eley-Rideal kinetic model. The hydroxylation reaction mechanism underling to the developed model involved three elementary reactions: (1) adsorption of H2O2 molecules on the iron active sites, (2) chemical surface H2O2 decomposition into the hydroxyl radical species, and (3) reaction between adsorbed radical species and phenol in solution leading to the dihydroxybenzene formation and freeing the iron catalytic active sites (rds). This work contributes to the implementation of outstanding 3D Fe/SiC honeycomb monolithic reactors, with a dihydroxybenzene selectivity above 99% at 80 °C, for the sustainable production of hydroxylated aromatics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The synthesis of dihydroxybenzenes (DHBZ), essential chemical reagents in numerous industrial processes, with a high degree of selectivity and yield from the hydroxylation of phenol is progressively attracting great interest in the catalysis field. Furthermore, the additive manufacturing of catalysts to produce 3D printed monoliths would provide additional benefits to enhance the DHBZ synthesis performance. Herein, 3D cellular Fe/γ-Al2O3 monoliths with a total porosity of 88% and low density (0.43 g·cm-3) are printed by Robocasting from pseudoplastic Fe-metal-organic frameworks (Fe-MOF)-based aqueous boehmite inks to develop catalytic monoliths containing a Fe network of dispersed clusters (≤5 μm), nanoclusters (<50 nm), and nanoparticles (∼20 nm) into the porous ceramic skeleton. The hydroxylation of phenol in the presence of hydrogen peroxide is carried out at different reaction temperatures (65-85 °C) in a flow reactor filled with eight stacked 3D Fe/γ-Al2O3 monoliths and with the following operating conditions: Cphenol,0 = 0.33 M, Cphenol,0/CH2O2,0 = 1:1 molar, WR = 2.2 g, and space time (τ = W·QL-1) = 0-147 gcat·h·L-1. The scaffolds present a good mechanical resistance (∼1 MPa) to be employed in a catalytic reactor and do not show any cracks or damage after the chemical reaction. DHBZ selectivity (SDHBZ) of 100% with a yield (YDHBZ) of 32% due to the presence of the Fe network in the monoliths is reported at 85 °C, which represents an improved synthesis performance as compared to that obtained by using the conventional Enichem process and the well-known titanium silicalite-1 catalysts (SDHBZ = 99.1% and YDHBZ = 29.6% at 80 °C). This printing strategy allows manufacturing novel 3D structured catalysts for the synthesis of critical chemical compounds with higher reaction efficiencies. ©

ABSTRACT: The processing and characterization of laminates based on Ti2AlC MAX phase, as matrix, and triaxial alumina braids, as reinforcing phase, are presented. Ti2AlC powders with a mean particle size below 1 µm are synthesized, while commercial 3M Nextel 610 alumina fibers are braided in a three-stage process consisting of spooling, braiding with an angle of 0° and ±60° and the separation to single-layer fabric. The laminates are processed by layer-by-layer stacking, where 3 two-dimensional alumina braids are interleaved between Ti2AlC layers, followed by full densification using a Field-Assisted Sintering Technology/Spark Plasma Sintering. The multifunctional response of the laminates, as well as for the monolithic Ti2AlC, is evaluated, in particular, the thermal and electrical conductivity, the oxidation resistance, and the mechanical response. The laminates exhibit an anisotropic thermal and electrical behavior, and an excellent oxidation resistance at 1200℃ in air for a week. A relatively lower characteristic biaxial strength and Weibull modulus (i.e., σ0 = 590 MPa and m = 9) for the laminate compared to the high values measured in the monolithic Ti2AlC (i.e., σ0 = 790 MPa and m = 29) indicates the need but also the potential of optimizing MAX-phase layered structures for multifunctional performance. © 2021 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Three-dimensional (3D) Fe/SiC monoliths with parallel interconnected channels and different cell geometries (square, troncoconical, and triangular) were manufactured by robocasting and used as catalytic reactors in hydroxylation of phenol using hydrogen peroxide to produce dihydroxybenzenes; the reaction was performed at Cphenol,0 = 0.33 M, Cphenol,0:CH2O2,0 = 1:1 M, WR = 3.7 g, T = 80-90 °C, and τ = 0-254 gcat·h·L-1 with water as a solvent. The values of the apparent kinetic rate constants demonstrated the superior performance of the triangular cell monoliths for hydrogen peroxide decomposition, phenol hydroxylation, and dihydroxybenzene production reactions. A computational fluid dynamic model was validated with the experimental results. It demonstrated that the triangular cell monoliths, with a lower channel hydraulic diameter and not-facing interconnections, provided a higher internal macrotortuosity that induced an oscillating flow of the liquid phase inside the channels, leading to an additional transverse flow between adjacent parallel channels. This behavior, not observed in the other two geometries, resulted in a better overall performance. © 2021 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Novel 3D Fe/SiC honeycomb monolithic reactors with different morphologies (i.e. cell geometry, cell density and interconnected channel pattern) have been conceptually designed, digitally prototyped and manufactured by robocasting. Square, tronco-conical and triangular cell geometries with parallel channels presenting staggered or faced interconnections have been tested in the phenol hydroxylation reaction with hydrogen peroxide to produce dihydroxybenzenes, such as catechol and hydroquinone. The analysis of the valence state of iron in the monoliths by Mössbauer spectroscopy identified iron silicides, viz. Fe3Si and α-FeSi2, as the iron catalytic species. The results demonstrate that an increased macro-channel tortuosity, favoured by a high density cell and a high number of not-facing inter-connected channels, facilitates the selectivity to the dihydroxybenzenes. In particular, 3D Fe/SiC monoliths with triangular cells provide an outstanding improvement with respect to the commercial process, not only because of their superior performance (SDHBZ=99.1% and YDHBZ=29.6% at 80 ºC) and stability (over 8 days on stream) but also in sustainability (i.e. operation in flow-reactor, no need of catalyst filtration, water as unique solvent). The additive manufacturing has allowed the smart integration of the catalytic phase into the monolithic structure, enabling, by this way, to architecture the reactor independently on its chemical composition. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The ability of boehmite to form printable inks has sparked interest in the manufacturing of 3D alumina (Al2 O3) and composite structures by enabling direct ink writing methods while avoiding the use of printing additives. These materials may exhibit high porosity due to the printing and sintering procedures, depending on the intended application. The 3D-printed porous composite structures of γ-Al2 O3 and α-Al2 O3 containing 2 wt.% of carbon nanotubes or reduced graphene oxide ribbons were fabricated from boehmite gels, followed by different heat treatments. The reinforcing effect of these carbon nanostructures was evidenced by compression tests carried out on the different alumina structures. A maximum relative increase of 50% in compressive strength was achieved for the γ-Al2 O3 composite structure reinforced with reduced graphene oxide ribbons, which was also accompanied by an increase in the specific surface area. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Research activity on ceramic/graphene composites and hybrids has increased dramatically in the last decade. In this review, we provide an overview of recent contributions involving ceramics, graphene, and graphene-related materials (GRM, i.e., graphene oxide, reduced graphene oxide, and graphene nanoplatelets) with a primary focus on applications. We have adopted a broad scope of the term ceramics, therefore including some applications of GRM with certain metal oxides and cement-based matrices in the review. Applications of ceramic/graphene hybrids and composites cover many different areas, in particular, energy production and storage (batteries, supercapacitors, solar and fuel cells), energy harvesting, sensors and biosensors, electromagnetic interference shielding, biomaterials, thermal management (heat dissipation and heat conduction functions), engineering components, catalysts, etc. A section on ceramic/GRM composites processed by additive manufacturing methods is included due to their industrial potential and waste reduction capability. All these applications of ceramic/graphene composites and hybrids are listed and mentioned in the present review, ending with the authors’ outlook of those that seem most promising, based on the research efforts carried out in this field. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The improvement of heat dissipation in electronic and energy devices is a challenge that can be addressed through the use of highly porous materials. Presently, the additive manufacturing of 3D aluminum nitride is described, and different lattice patterns with porosities in the range 45–64 % are achieved by direct ink writing. All the structures are robust and the effective thermal conductivity (keff) for cuboid structures decreases by 50–75 % with the filament separation and shows anisotropic characteristics, since keff along the longitudinal axis of the scaffold is up to six times greater than for the transversal one. Heat transfer during free cooling experiments for cuboid and cylinder scaffolds, after rapid heating at temperatures above 1000 °C, takes place by radiation for temperatures &gt;500 °C and by convection through the complete cooling process. The heat dissipation time constants of both processes decrease almost linearly with the designed scaffold parameters of porosity and rod separation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) scaffoldings are used as templates to create lightweight 3D rGO/silica and rGO/silico-aluminate hybrids by a simple impregnation route and the sol-gel method. The printed rGO assemblies are infiltrated by the corresponding alkoxide precursor solution and gelled by exposure to ammonia vapours, producing an hybrid replica of the rGO structure. The hybrids show a significant prevalence of mesopores, with total porosity above 94 %, density of ∼ 0.1 g⋅cm−3 and high specific surface area (≥ 190 m2⋅g−1). As a result, the 3D composite materials show enhanced water adsorption capacity and hydrophilicity, display compressive strengths in the range 0.1 – 0.4 MPa, which scale with the proportion of silica (or Al-modified silica) on the hybrid scaffold, and electrical conductivities are above 60 S⋅m−1. These properties are very attractive for applications in the removal of pollutants, water filtering, catalysis, drug delivery, or energy production and storage. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The present work merges two key strategies for the manufacturing of advanced ceramics, in particular, the development of functionally graded materials (FGMs) and the addition of graphene-based fillers into a ceramic matrix. A silicon nitride/reduced graphene oxide FGM composite is produced, in one step, from a single powder composition using the spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique with an asymmetric setting of the punches and die to create a continuous temperature gradient along the cross section of the powder compact. A deep microstructural and mechanical characterization has been done across the specimen thickness. The FGM composite exhibits bottom-top gradients in both the matrix grain size (150% increase) and α-phase content (89→1%). The FGM bottom surface is 10% harder than the top one and, on the other hand, the latter is 15% tougher. The presence of reduced graphene oxide sheets homogeneously distributed within the ceramic composite reduces the mechanical gradients compared to the monolithic silicon nitride FGM, although allows reaching a maximum long-crack toughness value of 9.4 MPa·m1/2 . In addition, these graphene-based fillers turn the insulating ceramics into an electrical conductor material. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: The promising applications of metal-organic frameworks (MOF) can be widened if these materials were additive manufactured to develop three-dimensional (3D) MOF architectures. In this work, iron-based MOF/silicon carbide (SiC) composite aqueous inks with a high solids content (64 ​wt%) are printed into 3D periodic lattices by a direct ink writing technique (Robocasting). MOF appear fully integrated within the cellular architectures, which display total porosities in the range of 74–78% depending on the scaffold design. The 3D MOF-Fe/SiC structures exhibit good mechanical strength (~4.6 ​MPa) and a semiconductor-like behaviour. The structures show a remarkable response in the hydroxylation of phenol with hydrogen peroxide, demonstrating high selectivity and yield to dihydroxybenzene species. © 2020 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The present work explores the strength enhancement via minor modifications of the pattern design in pure light SiC woodpile structures created by filament printing. In particular, the effect of the filament stacking angle on both the compression resistance and the elastic modulus of these structures are evaluated. Different patterns were designed while maintaining the bulk structure density, therefore the differences in the mechanical data (strength and elastic modulus) are not attributable to density variations. All of these materials were partially sintered at intermediate temperature for additional porosity enhancement. Moreover, SiC specimens made by full filament overlapping were produced to serve as reference massive material. Remarkably, the massive SiC printed material displays ordered spherical porosity and a closed-pore foam appearance, thus revealing a novel route for producing these type of porosity. Results evidence that the structure robustness can be tuned through slight design modification, which thus offers the possibility of further structure lightening without reducing the target strength. © 2020 SECV.

ABSTRACT: Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has been explored as a catalyst for degrading persistent organic pollutants in wastewater by Catalytic Wet Peroxide Oxidation (CWPO). Herein, the superior activity of the h-BN on the phenol degradation (model pollutant) compared to other metal-free catalysts, such as carbon-based ones, and the lower selectivity to CO encourage the potential application of h-BN catalysts in CWPO processes. Through a combined density functional theory calculations, experimental reactions and catalyst characterization approach, a comprehensive study on the reaction mechanism has been conducted. According to this, only defected B atoms in the h-BN layer, protonated as B-(OH2)+, decompose the hydrogen peroxide into highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. The radical species diffuse towards inner h-BN regions and react with the phenol adsorbed by π-π interaction on the h-BN surface. Oxidation by-products cause carbonaceous deposits and progressive deactivation of the h-BN catalyst that can be directly regenerated by burning off in air. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Herein, the formation of carbon monoxide as a harmful product upon the Catalytic Wet Peroxide Oxidation process is studied in presence of different solid catalysts: an iron supported activated carbon catalyst, a metal-free catalyst based on Graphene Nanoplatelets, and 1.6 wt.% Fe containing Cr2AlC MAX phase catalyst. The CWPO performance and the evolution of the gas effluent have been compared to that obtained in a conventional Fenton process. Carbon monoxide yield released was significantly lower in Catalytic Wet Peroxide Oxidation process in relation to that obtained in the Fenton process, where CO concentration reaches a maximum of 6651 mg/Nm3. By contrast, in presence of activated carbon-Fe catalyst and, notably, Graphene Nanoplatelets and Cr2AlC MAX phase catalysts, a more progressive phenol and aromatics intermediates oxidation resulted in a much lower CO maximum concentration in the gas phase at the exit of the reactor of 2454 mg/Nm3, 170 mg/Nm3 and 187 mg/Nm3, respectively. Hence, when compared to the homogeneous Fenton oxidation, Catalytic Wet Peroxide Oxidation process results be a more sustainable treatment for high-loaded phenolic wastewaters by decreasing the hazardous CO gaseous emissions avoiding this way a secondary pollution during the oxidation process. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The remarkable tunability of 2D carbon structures combined with their non-toxicity renders them interesting candidates for thermoelectric applications. Despite some limitations related to their high thermal conductivity and low Seebeck coefficients, several other unique properties of the graphene-like structures could out-weight these weaknesses in some applications. In this study, hybrid structures of alumina ceramics and graphene encapsulated alumina nanofibers are processed by spark plasma sintering to exploit advantages of thermoelectric properties of graphene and high stiffness of alumina. The paper focuses on thermal and electronic transport properties of the systems with varying content of nanofillers (1–25 wt.%) and demonstrates an increase of the Seebeck coefficient and a reduction of the thermal conductivity with an increase in filler content. As a result, the highest thermoelectric figure of merit is achieved in a sample with 25 wt.% of the fillers corresponding to ~3 wt.% of graphene content. The graphene encapsulated nanofibrous fillers, thus, show promising potential for thermoelectric material designs by tuning their properties via carrier density modification and Fermi engineering through doping. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The tribological behaviour of silicon nitride (Si3N4) ceramics is investigated using a two-step strategy. A set of ceramic composites containing silicon carbide nanoparticles (SiCn) is developed and, subsequently, graphene-based fillers are added to the Si3N4/SiC composite with the best tribological performance. The friction coefficient and the wear rate of Si3N4 are reduced up to 22 % and 40 %, respectively, when a 10 vol.% of SiCn is incorporated into the ceramic matrix due to its improved mechanical response. Si3N4/SiC composites containing 11 vol.% of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) or reduced graphene oxide sheets (rGOs) are analysed under isooctane lubrication and dry testing. rGOs composite leads to an important decrease of the friction coefficient (50 %) under lubricated conditions, and an enhancement of the wear resistance (44 %) under dry sliding tests, as compared to the reference Si3N4/SiC. The best performance of rGOs composite is due to the nature of the lubricating tribofilm and its excellent toughness. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The thermal conductivity (κ) is a key parameter that defines many of the technological uses of three-dimensional (3D) porous architectures. Despite the variety of methods for determining κ, problems generally arise when researchers try to apply them to cellular materials and 3D structures. The present work proposes an affordable lab-made device for analysing anisotropic heat flow in 3D porous architectures via high resolution infrared thermography. The method is validated using dense materials of known thermal conductivity. Temperature gradients measured for porous specimens have been correlated to the thermal conductivity estimated from a simple resistors model, assessing the main factors that affect the experimental measurements. The porous specimens of SiC, MAX-phase and graphene-based nanostructures are in-house manufactured by direct ink writing (robocasting). © 2020 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Highly porous scaffolds of Si3N4 are fabricated by direct ink writing method (Robocasting) with a pattern of macroporous cavities of 650–700 μm. Two different Si3N4 ink compositions regarding the oxide sintering aids (namely, Y2O3, Al2O3, and SiO2) are tried. Both inks reach solid volume fractions of ~0.40 with about 10–12 wt% of polymeric additive content that imparts the necessary pseudoplastic characteristics. The printed structures are sintered under controlled N2 atmosphere either in a conventional graphite furnace or by the spark plasma sintering technique. Skeleton of the scaffolds reaches densities above 95% of the theoretical value with ≈18–24% of linear shrinkage. Analysis of the crystalline phases, microstructure and mechanical properties are comparatively done for both compositions. The bioactivity of these structures is addressed by evaluating the ion release rate in simulated body fluid. In parallel, atomic force microscopy is used to determine the effect of the filaments surface roughness on protein adsorption (Bovine Serum Albumin) for assessing the potential application of 3D-Si3N4 scaffolds in bone regeneration. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: This paper explores the catalytic behaviour of different graphene-based nanostructures for the treatment of wastewater using Catalytic Wet Peroxide Oxidation (CWPO) processes. In a first stage, graphene-based nanopowders with distinct physical-chemical characteristics are tested in the CWPO of phenol using the following standard operating conditions: [Phenol]0 = 1 g·L−1, [H2O2]0 = 5 g L−1 and 80 °C. Graphene nanoplatelets with the lowest oxygen content exhibit the highest catalytic activity. The typical phenol oxidation by-products are detected in the liquid phase while CO and CO2 appear in the gas phase. Afterwards, three dimensional (3D) porous graphene monoliths (D ∼ 11.5 mm, H ∼ 4 mm, Dopen ∼ 0.68 mm and δw =0.36 cm, 75 cells·cm−2, εgraphene skeleton = 41%) based on those nanoplatelets are additive manufactured using a direct ink writing technique and, then, tested under similar CWPO conditions. The results evidence that the 3D graphene-based structures are catalytically active, though they undergo a progressive deactivation due to the deposition of organic matter. The graphene-based monoliths can be regenerated by thermal treatments, allowing their use at industrial scale by means of reaction-thermal regeneration cycles. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Architected Cu/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) heterostructures are achieved by electrodepositing copper on filament-printed rGO scaffolds. The Cu coating perfectly contours the printed rGO structure, but isolated Cu particles also permeate inside the filaments. Although the Cu deposition conveys a certain mass augment, the three-dimensional (3D) structures remain reasonably light (bulk density ∼ 0.42 g·cm-3). The electrical conductivity (σe) of the Cu/rGO structure (∼8 × 104 S·m-1) shows a notable increment compared to σe of the rGO structure (∼2 × 102 S·m-1). The effect on the scaffold robustness is also notable with an increase of the compressive strength by nearly 10 times (from 20 kPa of the rGO scaffold to 150 kPa of the Cu/rGO structure) and cyclability as well. The improved thermal conductivity of the Cu-coated scaffolds (∼4 times higher), in addition to the σe and strength improvements, suggests that 3D Cu/rGO structures could be suitable assemblies for integration into thermal dissipation systems, particularly as thermal interface materials, for compact electronic devices. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

ABSTRACT: Dry reciprocating sliding tests have been performed on cubic yttria-stabilized zirconia ceramic composites containing graphene nanoplatelets. The composites exhibit an excellent friction response and, especially, an outstanding improvement of the wear resistance of more than two orders of magnitude, as compared to unfilled ceramics. The enhanced tribological response of these composites is much greater than that commonly reported for ceramic/graphene materials. The deep analysis of worn surfaces by combining confocal Raman, scanning electron and atomic force microscopies reveals the presence of abundant twisted graphene-based rolls on top of a thick carbonaceous tribofilm that played a decisive protagonist to extraordinarily improve the tribological performance of the composites through a roller-bearing like effect. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Composites of 8 mol.% yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ) with graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) have been pointed as alternative interconnectors in SOFC due to their mixed ionic-electronic conduction. Here we show that GNP addition provides rising crack-resistance behavior, with long crack toughness up to 78% higher than that of 8YSZ, also improving its thermal conductivity (up to 6 times for the in-plane direction). Toughness versus crack length is measured for 7 and 11 vol.% of GNP using single edge V-notched beam technique and ultrashort pulsed laser notching; and thermal behavior is analyzed by the laser flash method. Materials also have highly anisotropic coefficient of thermal expansion. These properties contribute to enhance their performance under the harsh operating conditions of SOFC, as thermal residual stresses could be reduced while significantly improving the system mechanical stability. Moreover, the heat transfer may be enhanced especially along the interface direction which would increase the system efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: A semi-crystalline iron-based metal-organic framework (MOF), in particular Fe-BTC, that contained 20 wt.% Fe, was sustainably synthesized at room temperature and extensively characterized. Fe-BTC nanopowders could be used as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the synthesis of dihydroxybenzenes (DHBZ), from phenol with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), as oxidant under organic solvent-free conditions. The influence of the reaction temperature, H2O2 concentration and catalyst dose were studied in the hydroxylation performance of phenol and MOF stability. Fe-BTC was active and stable (with negligible Fe leaching) at room conditions. By using intermittent dosing of H2O2, the catalytic performance resulted in a high DHBZ selectivity (65%) and yield (35%), higher than those obtained for other Fe-based MOFs that typically require reaction temperatures above 70◦C. The long-term experiments in a fixed-bed flow reactor demonstrated good Fe-BTC durability at the above conditions. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: Acoustic properties of an additive-manufactured SiC scaffold with hexagonal symmetry fabricated by the robocasting method are studied both numerically and experimentally. The numerical analysis is based on the finite element method (FEM) using Bloch boundary conditions. The calculations show both angular and frequency dispersion of the acoustic waves with wavelengths comparable to the spacing between the rods, i.e., on a millimeter scale, indicating interesting acoustic properties in the MHz range. The dispersion character leads to focusing of the energy propagation into the directions of the rods of the hexagonal structure. This is illustrated by modal-based calculations of the propagation of longitudinal and out-of-plane shear wave packets with a dominant wavelength. The experimental analysis consists of two steps, the measurement of the resonant spectrum and shear wave propagation character. The measured resonant spectrum is in good agreement with the one calculated using numerically obtained low-frequency properties of the structure, also showing the quality of the overall manufactured structure. The time-domain measurement shows significant changes in the energy propagation between low and high frequencies, as predicted by FEM calculations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Steady graphene oxide (GO) scaffolds created by direct ink writing are used to develop a silicon carbonitride (SiCN) -graphene oxide hybrid material through a preceramic polymer route. For achieving mechanically stable GO scaffolds, the drying method is critical as the ink contains about 5 wt.% of GO, 10 wt.% of polyelectrolytes and 85 wt.% of water. The liquid preceramic polymer (polysilazane type) quickly infiltrates the 3D scaffolds, under vacuum conditions, entirely covering the GO network creating a replica of the original scaffold. The hybrid cellular structure -once thermally treated for GO reduction and ceramic conversion- consists of a network of reduced GO (∼10 wt.%) embedded in an amorphous SiCN matrix following the designed architecture. The 3D hybrid structures show notable electrical conductivity (890 S m−1 at room temperature), thermal stability and considerable strength, about 20 times higher than the single GO scaffold. The structures are tested as electrodes for supercapacitors, reaching a gravimetric capacitance of 39 F g−1 that remains stable after 7000 charge/discharge cycles. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Continuous epitaxial graphene (EG) films have been grown on polished surfaces of dense polycrystalline SiC ceramics by heating in a Spark Plasma Sintering furnace (SPS). The confining of the sample into a graphite die and the use of a high pulsed dc current that triggers the joule heating of the system play a key role in the graphene formation by Si sublimation. The polycrystalline nature of the sample has allowed the comparison, through different local probe microscopies and micro-Raman spectroscopy, between EG films simultaneously grown on different SiC faces at exactly the same conditions, providing valuable information on their thickness, quality and stresses. Notably, whereas a graphene bilayer grows over Si-face grains, multilayer graphene (∼10 layers) forms on C-faces. The observed nano-electronic and nano-mechanical heterogeneities of the surface, showing up as differences in charge state and strain release mechanisms, are found to arise from the dependence of the EG properties when developed on each grain orientation; the same applies in the case of the macro-mechanical scratch resistance. SPS demonstrates to be a reliable and flexible methodology to prepare continuous graphene films on SiC components with many possibilities for scaling-up at low cost. © 2019

ABSTRACT: The arrangement of 2D graphene-type structures into strong and self-supported architectures by filament printing depends critically on the ink characteristics. Printable inks are normally achieved by controlling the electro-steric interactions in the particle dispersion by different means. This research shows that is possible to use just a single surfactant for graphene-type inks, such as graphene oxide (GO), graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) and their mixtures, to achieve characteristics of gelled inks, in other words, shear-thinning behavior and a high elastic modulus at rest. The surfactant is a commercial hydrogel former of the poloxamer family that contains both hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks. These inks do not require lyophilization or supercritical drying processes, accordingly the method is simple, scalable and produces lightweight 3D printed structures that exhibit high strength and prominent electrical conductivity after heat treating at 1200 °C. Furthermore, it makes possible to adjust the proportion of GO and GNP in the ink to tailor the properties of the structure according to the pursued application. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The development of porous MAX-phase structures from computer-aided design models and 3D printing strategies is of great interest for the fabricating of cellular parts with geometric and material complexities for advanced technological applications. This is reinforced by the joining of the outstanding properties of MAX phases with the benefits of creating lighter materials with a higher surface area. Here, the additive manufacturing of 3D cellular Cr2AlC MAX-phase architectures using a direct ink writing technique from concentrated MAX aqueous-based inks is presented. These architectures exhibit multifunctional properties; in particular, high strength and good mechanical cycling behavior, excellent electrical conductivity, tailored heat dissipation, and good thermal cycling resistance, a blend that widens the potential engineering applications of these MAX phases through an innovative approach. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

ABSTRACT: The effect of large graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) additions on the friction and wear of silicon nitride (Si3N4) ceramics is evaluated under isooctane lubrication. All Si3N4/GNPs composites, with up to 20.6 vol% of graphene fillers, exhibit better tribological response than Si3N4, in particular, a 50% reduction in the friction that continuously decreases with the GNPs content is attained, jointly with an improvement in the wear resistance of up to 63%. The survival of a self-lubricant carbon-rich tribolayer formed on the worn surfaces controls the tribological properties of the materials. Si3N4/GNPs composites are promising materials to enhance the performance of gasoline direct injection systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Three-dimensional (3D) porous silicon carbide (SiC) structures with total porosity in the range of 64–85% are achieved from nanosized SiC powders by filament printing and partial sintering in a spark plasma sintering (SPS) furnace. The effects of the SPS temperature (1500 and 1700 °C) and the addition of oxide sintering aids (7 wt. % Y2O3+Al2O3) on the porosity of the scaffolds are quantitatively compared. More specifically, hierarchical porosity consisting of meso-pores (&lt; 50 nm) in the struts and open macro-pores (in the range of 500–700 μm) defined by the patterned structure is verified for the 1500 °C SPS treatment. The strength of the structures as a function of the density as well as their cooling profiles, once subjected to rapid heating under a direct flame, are analyzed. By following this easy route, an adaptable family of robust light 3D SiC structures with hierarchical porosity is accomplished. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Composites of 8 mol% Yttria-stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) containing 0, 7, 10 and 14 vol.% of graphene nano-platelets (GNP) were fully densified by Spark Plasma Sintering. The effect of GNP on the electrical performance of the composites was analyzed by impedance spectroscopy as a function of temperature (150–800 °C) and oxygen partial pressure (0.21–10−20 atm). Results show that below GNP percolation threshold (7.1 vol.%), the electrical behavior is dominated by the matrix oxygen-ion conductivity. Above the threshold, the conductivity is predominantly electronic provided by the GNP network. The total conductivity of composites was used as an indicator of GNP stability in different atmospheres. YSZ/GNP composites remain stable in inert conditions up to 600 °C, and in reducing conditions up to 800 °C, making them good alternatives to perovskite-based materials used for electrochemical applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: In this contribution, acoustic phenomena taking place in MHz frequency range in robocast ceramic scaffolds are presented. The acoustic properties of several scaffold geometries were studied both experimentally and numerically. The elastic responses were calculated by finite element method (FEM) where computational unit cells were designed to represent the periodic geometry of the sintered scaffolds. It is shown that tetragonal scaffolds, where the rods in the neighboring layers are perpendicular, focus acoustic energy along the principal directions of the ceramic rods. On the other hands, a hexagonal structure, which has the periodicity of 3 layers with the orientation angle of 60◦ between the neighboring rods, is in-plane isotropic in the low-frequency limit. The FEM study was also performed up to higher frequencies and it was found there are several frequency band gaps for the longitudinal waves. © 2019 9th ECCOMAS Thematic Conference on Smart Structures and Materials, SMART 2019.

ABSTRACT: The catalyst stability has become a key issue for wet peroxide oxidation (CWPO) processes. Herein, an alternative method for the manufacturing of iron (Fe) catalysts by using three-dimensional (3D) printing techniques is proposed to enhance the Fe immobilization, where these metallic nanoparticles are part of a printable aqueous silicon carbide (SiC)-based ink. Cylindrical Fe/SiC monoliths (D ∼ 13 mm, H ∼ 4.5 mm, 74 squared cells cm−2) are manufactured by direct ink writing (Robocasting) and further treatment up to 1500 °C into a spark plasma sintering (SPS) furnace to assure a certain mechanical integrity. It was found that the increasing SPS temperature progressively decreases the porosity -or increases the apparent density- of the printed struts, lowering the accessibility of reactants to the Fe sites but improving the catalyst mechanical strength and leaching resistance. 3D Fe/SiC monoliths treated at 1200 °C arise as robust catalysts for CWPO processes due to the combination of good catalytic activity, highly- efficient H2O2 decomposition, long-term stability and excellent mechanical strength. A simple potential kinetic model is proposed, capable of describing the phenol disappearance, TOC removal and H2O2 consumption. The results of this study point out a new approach for the conformation by Robocasting of metal-based catalysts in suitable morphological 3D-structures for scaling-up reactions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Thermal sprayed thick glass coatings with a small percentage of multilayer graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) demonstrate electrical functionality with a quite remarkable low percolation limit (1.18 vol.%). This low critical content and the high electrical conductivity (∼40 S m−1) observed for the in-plane direction are related to the peculiar coating microstructure, formed by the pileup of lamellar amorphous particles decorated by GNP mostly following a surface parallel orientation. The general effective media model fitting to the electrical conductivity data for these coatings suggests a 3D connectivity of graphene and estimates an upper limit conductivity for the GNP of 105 S m−1. Hall effect shows the n-type behavior intrinsic to the SiO2/graphene interface, and carrier density and mobility rising with the GNP content. In addition, the coatings evidence a very high solar absorptivity that jointly with their high electrical conductivity broadens their potential applications, among others, for electromagnetic interference shielding or as photothermal detector and solar absorber for solar steam generation and water desalination. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Anisotropic elastic and acoustic properties of robocast ceramic scaffolds are calculated by finite element method, utilizing real geometries and material parameters obtained from robocast silicon carbide samples. Six types of robocast geometries are studied, showing different material symmetries given by the arrangement of the ceramic rods in the scaffold structures. Due to the macroscopic periodicity of the structures composed of fully sintered ceramic rods, the robocast scaffolds exhibit metamaterial-like elastic and acoustic properties, never observed for natural materials. The effect of the micro-architecture is shown to be crucial: while for tetragonal and orthorhombic structures, strong acoustic focusing along the directions of the rods appears even in the low-frequency limit, hexagonal structures exhibit no energy focusing up to some frequency limit given by the geometry. © 2018 Polish Academy of Sciences.

ABSTRACT: The tribological performance of silicon carbide (SiC)/graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) composites is analysed under oscillating sliding tests lubricated with isooctane, looking to explore their potential as components for gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines. High graphene filler contents (20 vol.% of GNPs) are required to substantially reduce the friction coefficient of SiC ceramics, attaining decreases on friction up to 30% independently of the applied load. For all materials and testing conditions a mild wear regime is evidenced. SiC/20 vol.% GNPs composite also enhances the wear resistance up to 35% at low load, but the addition of GNPs produces a deleterious effect as the load augments. The tribological behaviour depends on the formation and destabilization of a solid lubricant carbon-based tribofilm and strongly correlates with the mechanical properties of the tested materials. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: In situ observations are performed, for the first time, of stable crack propagation in nanocomposites of silicon nitride (Si3N4) and reduced graphene-oxide (rGO) inside a scanning-electron microscope. Two different specimen geometries (wedge-splitting and double-cantilever beam) are used to observe crack interactions with rGO stacks in two different orientations (cross-section and in-plane). These observations provide new insights into the unique, effective pull-out of crack-bridging rGO stacks, which appears to be responsible for the extraordinary toughness in the Si3N4/rGO nanocomposites. These insights could be used to design and create future ceramic/rGO nanocomposites with superior mechanical properties. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: A low temperature method for the fabrication of architected ceramic composites contining graphene is developed based on the infiltration of lightweight graphene oxide (GO) micro-lattices with a preceramic polymer. Self-supported highly porous three-dimensional (3D) GO structures fabricated by direct ink writing are infiltrated with a liquid organic-polysilazane (a compound of Si, C, H, N), and subsequently pyrolyzed at temperatures of 800–1000 ºC to activate the ceramic conversion. These ceramic composites replicate the patterned GO skeleton and, whereas the graphene network provides the conductive path for the composite (electrical conductivity in the range 0.2–4 S cm−1), the ceramic wrapping serves as a protective barrier against atmosphere, temperature (up to 900 °C in air) and even direct flame. These structured composites also show hydrophobicity (wetting angle above 120°) and better load bearing capacity than the corresponding 3D GO lattice. The process is very versatile, being applicable to different liquid precursors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The short-crack domain and contact damage resistances of silicon carbide (SiC) ceramics containing graphene fillers (graphene nanoplatelets -GNPs- or reduced graphene oxide sheets -rGOs) are investigated by performing Hertzian contact tests. A progressive deviation from the linear Hertzian elastic response with increasing graphene content takes place, the composite containing 20 vol.% GNPs being the most deformable material. When adding increasing amounts of GNPs, the damage beneath the contact zone turns from well-defined cone cracks of monolithic SiC to a widespread subsurface damage where microcracks are generated due to the matrix/graphene interface debonding by a shear faulting process. This mechanism enhances the contact damage resistance of the composites, redistributing the stresses at the contact and limiting the long-crack formation. The composite containing 5 vol.% rGOs fully precludes the cone cracks development and enlarges the quasi-plastic damage zone, extraordinarily enhancing the contact damage resistance that approaches to that of a ductile material. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The transmission of longitudinal ultrasonic waves through periodic ceramic microlattices fabricated by Robocasting was measured in the 2–12 MHz frequency range. It was observed that these structures (scaffolds of tetragonal and hexagonal spatial arrangements with periodicity at length-scales of ∼100 μm) exhibit well-detectable acoustic band structures with bandgaps. The locations of these gaps at relatively high frequencies were shown to be in close agreement with the predictions of numerical models, especially for tetragonal scaffolds. For hexagonal scaffolds, a mixing between longitudinal and shear polarizations of the propagation modes was observed in the model, which blurred the matching of the calculated band structures with the experimentally measured bandgaps. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The electrical discharge machining (EDM) performance of silicon carbide (SiC) ceramics containing graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) is investigated for the first time. Under fine machining conditions, the material removal rate (MRR) dramatically increases up to 186% when 20 vol.% of GNPs are added to SiC ceramics, leading to reductions on the electrode wear rate of 132%. The EDMed nanocomposites exhibit surface roughness ≤ 0.8 μm. This outstanding EDM response of the graphene nanocomposites as compared to monolithic SiC is explained by their enhanced transport properties, establishing a direct dependence of MRR with the electrical conductivity. EDM performance of the nanocomposites also depends on the testing direction for materials with low GNPs connectivity (≤ 10 vol.%). Melting/evaporation are the main removal mechanisms, thermal spalling also operating for low thermal conducting materials. The employ of EDM on SiC/graphene nanocomposites allows machining microparts with a fine dimensional precision, opening new opportunities for SiC-based microcomponents. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: A revision on ceramic/graphene composites is presented. The more representative results for a wide number of bulk composites are compared, making special emphasis on their mechanical (fracture toughness, strength) and elastic properties, along with wear and friction topics. The electrical functionality boosted by the contacted graphene network is critically assessed for conducting and dielectric ceramic matrices. Regarding thermal transport, the enhancement or depletion of thermal conductivity is reviewed for different materials and specific orientations. Furthermore, new developments on layered materials and coatings, as well as on three-dimensional cellular composites, which certainly widen the scope of applications for this remarkable group of ceramic materials, are looked over. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: A new class of ceramic matrix composites based on Cr2AlC MAX-phase containing 5 and 10 wt.% of SiC fibers was developed in this investigation. The Cr2AlC/SiC composites were performed through two consecutives steps: i) synthesis of the pure Cr2AlC phase from its elemental constituents by reactive method under argon atmosphere at 1400 °C and particle size refinement, and ii) processing of Cr2AlC powder and SiC fibers followed by densification using the field assisted sintering technology/spark plasma sintering. Cr2AlC/SiC composites presented high density (98.6%) with an excellent dispersion of the fibers within the matrix and a strong matrix/fiber interfase. Tribological behavior of the developed composites was studied under dry conditions to reveal the role played by the SiC fibers. Incorporation of the SiC fibers within the Cr2AlC matrix reduced the friction coefficient up to 20% for low testing loads, while the wear resistance increased up to 70–80% independently of the applied load. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Robocasting is an additive manufacturing method, which is capable of fabricating microarchitectured scaffolds, consisting of periodically repeating thin ceramic rods in various spatial arrangements. Fully sintered ceramic scaffolds are obtained by a combination of layer-by-layer 3D printing and subsequent presureless spark plasma sintering of the printed green ceramic bodies. Due to the complex structures with easily tunable geometric parameters, phononic crystals can be fabricated by the robocasting method. In this contribution, elastic and acoustic properties of the robocast silicon carbide scaffold are shown, utilizing a combination of resonant ultrasound spectroscopy measurement and finite element modeling. The scaffold is highly anisotropic in elastic properties, which leads to a strong acoustic energy focusing along the principal axes of the silicon carbide rods. Moreover, frequency band gaps in MHz range are detected by measur-ing longitudinal wave transmission, which is compared with a theoretical prediction by the finite element modeling. © 2018 Acoustical Society of America.

ABSTRACT: Longitudinal elastic wave propagation in ultrasonic frequency range (2 − 12 MHz) through periodic ceramic micro-architectures was studied by a though-transmission method. Silicon carbide micro-scaffolds fabricated by an additive manufacturing method called Robocasting were used for the experiments; micro-architectures with tetragonal, hexagonal and orthorhombic spatial arrangements were employed. The results prove that these micro-scaffolds exhibit well-detectable frequency band gaps, resulting from internal resonances of the periodic structure, especially when direction of the wave propagation is parallel to one of the symmetry directions of the micro-architecture. © 2017 International Center for Numerical Methods in Engineering.

ABSTRACT: Graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) have proved to be effective fillers for enhancing the mechanical and tribological properties of bulk ceramics and glasses, also with the added benefit of developing electrical and thermal functionalities. Similarly, enhanced transport performance has recently been shown for glass-ceramics coatings of the Y2O3-Al2O3-SiO2 (YAS) system containing a small amount of GNP fillers, intended for applications in the aerospace industry. In the present work, the wear and friction behaviour of GNP/YAS coatings –containing 0, 1.2 and 2.3 wt.% GNPs- on silicon carbide substrates is evaluated. The flame spraying process used for coating fabrication induces a structure of splats oriented parallel to the substrate with GNPs located at the inter-splat boundaries forming a connected network of platelets mainly oriented parallel to the surface as well. Unlubricated ball–on-plate reciprocating wear tests show that both the friction coefficient and the wear rate decreased by 35% and 65%, respectively, for 2.3 wt.% of GNPs. A wear mechanism for GNP/YAS coatings based on both the progressive exfoliation of the graphene sheets and the effect of the GNPs on preventing crack propagation within the coating is proposed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Dense silicon carbide (SiC)-based composites containing up to 20 vol.% of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) were manufactured via a liquid-phase Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) process, employing Y2O3 and Al2O3 as sintering aids. The applied uniaxial pressure during SPS produced a preferential orientation of the GNPs, with the ab-plane perpendicular to the pressing axis, thus bringing about high thermal anisotropy. Thermal diffusivity/conductivity were measured as a function of the GNPs content, being enhanced by ∼30% in the perpendicular direction to the SPS pressing axis, whereas a moderate decrease was observed in the parallel direction owing to the much lower intrinsic conductivity of the aligned GNPs in the c-axis, with no significant contribution of the thermal resistance of the GNP-SiC interfaces. A non-monotonical temperature dependence for the thermal conductivity was detected in composites containing &lt;10 vol.% GNPs, explained by the strong p-doping of these SiC ceramics. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: In-situ grown graphene/SiC composites developed by spark plasma sintering have emerged as a very interesting family of materials with expected high performance for advanced applications. In this work, the local functional properties of graphene/SiC ceramics are elucidated for distinct α- and β- SiC polytypes combining scanning probe microscopies. We unambiguously identify all composite constituents and demonstrate the formation of a three-dimensional graphene conductive network inside the composite. The investigated composites exhibit grains with different doping level depending on growth rate during sintering so that conduction paths associated to graphene and matrix networks may compete. The relevance of nanoscale characterization on functional graphene/semiconductor materials is proved as it evidences the type of doping and carrier concentration of the semiconductor and the critical role played by the graphene constituent in the formation of ohmic contacts. Both issues are of crucial importance for understanding the macroscale behavior of these materials and determine their applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The manufacturing of three-dimensional (3D) graphene monoliths with remarkable electrical performance has become a challenging issue because their potential applications in the energy and electronic-based fields. Here we show the development of outstanding electrically conductive graphene patterned cellular structures combining a versatile and easily scalable filament printing method, such as Robocasting, with the use of highly crystalline graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) as the graphene source. Robust 3D pure graphene-based monoliths have been manufactured by printing pseudoplastic aqueous-based GNPs inks with high graphene contents (36.6 wt %) and further thermal treatment by spark plasma sintering. Specific conductivities up to 385 S·cm-1 have been assessed along the longitudinal direction of the 3D structure, i.e., where the current mainly flowed along the struts, being more conductor than reported 3D synthesized graphene structures and up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than 3D printed graphene monoliths. The present findings could open a straightforward pathway for creating, in a controlled way, a wide range of graphene-based hierarchical structures with an excellent electrical performance and robustness that could be employed for energy storage systems. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

ABSTRACT: Lightweight, three-dimensional (3D) cellular structures of graphene/silicon carbide (SiC) showing very low densities (&lt;1.6 g cm-3) as compared to the dense skeleton (&lt;3.2 g cm-3) have been fabricated by a filament-based printing technique known as Robocasting. These scaffolds have been assembled from pseudoplastic inks containing homogeneous mixtures of SiC ceramic powders and up to 20 vol.% of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), and densified by pressureless spark plasma sintering. The electrical conductivity (σ) of the scaffolds shows certain anisotropy with the structure orientation and increases with the GNPs volume fraction. In this way, σ values of up to 611 S m-1 for the longitudinal and 273 S m-1 for the transverse orientations of the structures relative to the extruded rods are achieved. First attempts to model the electrical behavior of robocast scaffolds using both analytical and finite-element methods are described. The models provide a correct description of general trends in the conductivity and anisotropy, and are expected to be useful as a first approach to anticipate the trends of other properties, as the thermal conductivity, of such complex multifunctional cellular materials, thus narrowing the experimental workload. Scaffolds tested under compression show crushing strengths in the range of 10-50 MPa, which increase with the relative density of the skeletons. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Nowadays, new materials with enhanced tribological properties are required to fulfil the new demanding working conditions of more efficient and eco-friendly industrial processes. To achieve this goal, we propose the addition of graphene nanofillers, a very attractive self-lubricating solid, to ceramic materials for improving their tribological responses. As proof of concept, here we present the role of the graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) on the friction and wear resistance of two different graphene/ceramic nanocomposites, in particular, GNPs/silicon nitride and GNPs/silicon carbide materials. The tribological tests evidence that GNPs are ideal nanofillers to increase the wear resistance, especially under high contact pressures, because the nanoplatelets are exfoliated during the sliding motion and lead to the formation of a carbon-based protecting film; whereas the benefits on the friction depend on the tribo-testing conditions. © 2015 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The role played by graphene in the friction and wear behaviour of graphene/silicon carbide (SiC) composites, tested under dry sliding conditions and using silicon nitride balls as counterbodies, is investigated as a function of the graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) content and the graphene source. GNPs composites show an enhanced wear resistance as compared to monolithic SiC, with maximum improvements of ~70% for the material containing up to 20 vol.% of GNPs; whereas the friction performance depends on the sliding distance and GNPs content. The analysis of the wear debris by micro-Raman spectroscopy evidenced that the tribological behaviour of the GNPs/SiC materials is linked to the formation of an adhered lubricating and protecting tribofilm. Multilayered graphene fillers participate more actively in the protecting tribofilm than other graphene sources such as reduced graphene oxide or in-situ grown graphene flakes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Silicon nitride (Si3N4) materials with preferentially aligned β-Si3N4 grains were tribologically characterized with respect to their possible application in a high-pressure gasoline pump. Tribological tests were performed under oscillating sliding conditions lubricated with isooctane as a substitute for gasoline using Si3N4 counterbodies. Performance in terms of wear of the aligned materials surpassed that of nonaligned reference Si3N4, as well as that of self-mated silicon carbide, zirconia, alumina, and a steel sliding pair. The plane perpendicular to the extruding direction and parallel to the hot-pressing axis was the most wear resistant. © 2015 The American Ceramic Society.

ABSTRACT: Graphene nanoplatelets and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were selected as fillers to develop reinforced silicon carbide (SiC)/graphene composites. The mechanical properties of the materials were investigated as a function of the type of graphene source and graphene content. Composites containing just 5 vol.% of rGOs exhibited an outstanding mechanical performance, increasing both the fracture toughness by ~ 162%, with a maximum value of 8.3 MPa · m1/2, and the strength by ~ 60% (600 MPa) when compared to monolithic SiC. The preferential alignment of the graphene fillers, their dimensions, and the graphene-SiC mechanical interlock are key factors to promote crack shielding mechanisms. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Elastic constants of silicon nitride composites with variable content (3-18wt.%) of two kinds of graphene fillers (nanoplatelets and reduced graphene oxide sheets) are determined using resonant ultrasound spectroscopy. The corresponding Young's modulus (E), shear modulus (G) and Poisson's ratio (ν) are calculated for each material. Composites show a noticeable anisotropy that grows stronger with the graphene filler content, owing to the preferential alignment of the graphene layers and to their own anisotropy as well. E and G monotonically decrease with the filler concentration for both types of fillers, showing a maximum decrease in E of 75% along the direction perpendicular to the graphene plane for the composite with the highest filler content (Si3N4-18wt.% GNP) and a reduction in G of 63% for shear along the graphene plane for the same composite. Influence on the fracture pattern of the composites is also addressed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Despite numerous works have recently reported the densification of silicon carbide (SiC) ceramics using the Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) technique, the effect of the localized electric current flow near the specimen over the liquid phase sintering process of SiC ceramics and on their microstructural features has not been completely addressed. In the present work, two different SPS setups affecting current flow are selected, one based on the ordinary die/punch setup configuration, and the other employing a BN electrically insulating coating on the inner wall of the die to force the electric current to locally flow through the inner graphite foil in contact with the ceramic compact. The effective electrical resistance and the energy consumed during the SPS runs for both setups, as well as the sintering behavior, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the SPSed materials are analyzed. The BN die coating considerably increases the effective resistance of the system, decreases the power consumption, and accelerates the SiC densification. Besides, ceramic specimens experience significantly higher real temperatures than the set values and, accordingly, coarser microstructures and tougher materials than those for the ordinary setting are produced. The thermoelectrical properties of SiC materials are proposed as fundamental in their SPS process, especially when electrical current is forced through the inner part of the SPS setting around the specimen. © 2015 The American Ceramic Society.

ABSTRACT: The paper describes the fabrication by liquid-phase spark plasma sintering (SPS) of composites of dense silicon carbide (SiC) with up to 20vol.% graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), and discusses the relationships between composition, microstructure and electrical conductivity. The structural integrity of the GNPs is preserved during the whole process, as observed by Raman spectroscopy. The effects of the applied pressure (50MPa) during SPS result in the preferential orientation of the GNPs perpendicular to the pressing axis and anisotropic electrical behaviour. The electrical conductivity measured in the direction perpendicular to the SPS pressing axis is 4 to 6 times higher than the parallel counterpart. The conductivity increases up to three orders of magnitude with increasing GNPs fraction, reaching values of 4380Sm-1 at room temperature for materials with 20vol.% GNPs. The conduction mechanism of the composite is analysed as a function of the GNPs content. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Synthesizing 3D carbon nanotube (CNT) networks with multifunctional characteristics has stimulated the interest from the scientific community since the 1990s. Here, the fabrication of a novel composite material consisting of 3D covalently interconnected multiwalled CNT with silicon carbide (SiC) nano and microparticles is reported. The material is synthesized by a two-step process involving the coating of CNT with silicon oxide (SiOx) via chemical routes, followed by spark plasma sintering (SPS). SPS enables carbothermal reduction of SiOx and subsequent densification of the material into 3D composite blocks. Covalent interconnections of CNT are facilitated by a carbon diffusion process resulting in SiC formation as SiOx coated CNT are subjected to high temperatures. The presence of SiC in the sintered composite has been confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, as well as through energy filtered transmission electron microscopy maps. Interestingly, the 3D CNT composite exhibits high thermal conductivity (16.72 W m-1 K-1); and also a semiconducting behavior with an electron hopping mechanism associated to a 3D variable range hopping model. These findings demonstrate that it is indeed possible to fabricate SiC-CNT composites with enhanced physical properties that can be used as multifunctional materials. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

ABSTRACT: By unzipping multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) it is possible to obtain graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) that could then be used as fillers in ceramic composites. Here we report the fabrication of silicon nitride (Si3N4) ceramics with different contents of GNRs by spark plasma sintering. The GNR fillers confer electrical conductivity to the Si3N4 composites, following a semiconducting-like behavior at relatively low volume filler concentrations (0.04). In addition, a toughening effect, produced by GNRs bridging the cracks was observed. GNRs appear to be an efficient alternative to graphene-based composites, useful in the fabrication of novel multifunctional ceramic composites. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Biomaterials can still be reinvented to become simple and universal bone regeneration solutions. Following this roadmap, conductive CNT-based "smart" materials accumulate exciting grafting qualities for tuning the in vitro cellular phenotype. Biphasic electrical stimulation of human osteoblastic cells was performed in vitro on either dielectric bioactive bone grafts or conductive CNT-reinforced composites. The efficiency of the electrical stimuli delivery, as well as the effect of stimulation on cellular functions were investigated. Conductive substrates boosted the local culture medium conductivity and the confinement of the exogenous electrical fields. Hence, bone cell proliferation, DNA content and mRNA expression were maximized on the conductive substrates yielding superior stimuli delivering efficiency over dielectric ones. These findings are suggestive that bioactive bone grafts with electrical conductivity are capable of high spatial and temporal control of bone cell stimulation.

ABSTRACT: Continuous in situ functionally graded silicon nitride materials with outstanding gradients in their morphological and mechanical characteristics are developed using the spark plasma sintering technique with an asymmetric setting of punches and die, and placing an electrical insulator barrier between the top punch and the ceramic powder compact. Temperature gradients well above 150 °C are created across the specimen inducing significant variations through the specimen thickness (3.5 mm) in phase transformation (78%) and grain size (240%). Hardness and toughness gradients of 2.0 GPa mm-1 and 1.2 MPa m1/2 mm-1, respectively, are attained. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Ultrasonic measurements combined with numerical modelling are used to analyze the elastic and acoustic properties of morphologically complex ceramic bodies assembled by the Robocasting technique. It is shown that the micromechanics of the robocast periodic scaffolds leads to several metamaterial-like wave propagation phenomena. Besides the expectable prominent elastic anisotropy and the frequency band structure resulting from the periodicity of the scaffold, a wave-mode mixing is observed that disables the conventional distinguishing between quasi-longitudinal, quasi-shear, and pure shear modes for propagation in the symmetry planes of the structure. This paper proves the capability of Robocasting, as a versatile three-dimensional (3D) printing method, to produce tailored acoustic metamaterials with very low damping and outstandingly strong acoustic anomalies. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

ABSTRACT: High pressure gasoline direct injection systems are able to considerably reduce both the fuel consumption and the harmful emissions, but the current metallic components should be replaced by new advanced materials with enhanced tribological properties. In this work, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)/silicon nitride (Si3N4) nanocomposites have been tested in a high-pressure 3-piston prototype pump for gasoline using both a cam/pusher self-mated system, and a nanocomposite cam/steel AISI 52100 pusher configuration. Si3N4 sliding systems were also tested as reference material. MWCNTs nanocomposite cams in combination with steel pushers present an outstanding performance at high rotation speeds and delivery pressures, showing mechanical efficiencies beyond 0.95, low cyclic variations, and torque oscillations 75% lower than the other tested material combinations. MWCNTs favour the formation of surface dimples where debris are entrapped, and promote tribochemical reactions with the steel pushers, enhancing the mechanical efficiency. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Highly homogenous carbon nanotube (CNT)/silicon nitride (Si 3N4) nanocomposites with high CNTs loadings, up to 22 vol.%, are developed through the in-situ synthesis of CNTs on the ceramic powders, and further densification using the spark plasma sintering technique. The CNTs dispersion degree, the composite density, and their properties, especially the tribological ones, are evaluated and compared with those obtained for nanocomposites processed by the ex-situ method based on the mixing of nanotubes and ceramic powders in a solvent media. Fully dense in-situ 12 vol.% CNTs nanocomposites are 87% and 65% more wear resistant than monolithic Si 3N4 materials and ex-situ nanocomposites, respectively, in the latter case due to the higher nanotubes dispersion and better mechanical properties attained by the in-situ process. These new in-situ CNTs nanocomposites present multifunctionality and are promising for emerging applications, especially for gasoline direct injection systems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Hertzian indentation was used to investigate for the first time the elastic-plastic behavior and contact damage evolution with temperature (in the 25-850. °C range) in air of different in situ grown graphene/SiC composites. Three SiC starting powders differing in polytypes and particle sizes were liquid-phase densified by spark-plasma sintering, thus producing ceramic composites that contain about 4. vol.% of epitaxial grown graphene flakes at the grain boundaries and have interesting differences in their microstructure. The general trend in the contact mechanical behavior is qualitatively similar among the different composites, with the elastic modulus, yield stress, and critical loads for the onset of quasi-plasticity and ring/cone cracking all decreasing with increasing temperature, with the differences at the quantitative level being explained in terms of the particular microstructure of each graphene/SiC composite. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Novel highly electrically conducting nanocomposites consisting of a silicon nitride (Si3N4) ceramic matrix containing up to 13.6vol.% of nitrogen-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNx) were fabricated. As-synthesized CNx were treated with hydrogen peroxide in order to efficiently detach/isolate the nanotubes from bundles, then they were mixed with the ceramic powders and fully densified using the spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. Composites containing 13.6vol.% CNx reached an electrical conductivity of 2174Sm-1 that is the highest value reported hitherto for carbon nanotubes/Si3N4 nanocomposites. The nitrogen doping also favored a strong mechanical interlocking between the nanotubes and the Si3N4 matrix; when compared to the undoped carbon nanotubes. These novel nanocomposites could be used in devices associated to power generation or telecommunications. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Two types of Si3N4 composites containing graphene nanostructures using two different graphene sources, pristine graphene nanoplatelets and graphene oxide layers were produced by Spark Plasma Sintering. The maximum toughness of 10.4MPam1/2, measured by flexure testing of pre-cracked bars, was achieved for a composite (~60β/40α-Si3N4, ~300nm grain size) with 4vol.% of reduced graphene oxide, indicating a toughening enhancement of 135% when compared to a similar Si3N4. This was also accompanied by a 10% increase in flexure strength (1040MPa). For the composites with thicker graphene nanoplateletes only a 40% of toughness increase (6.6MPam1/2) without strength improvement was observed for the same filler content. The large difference in the maximum toughness values accomplished for both types of composites was attributed to variations in the graphene/Si3N4 interface characteristics and the extent of monolayer graphene exfoliation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Silicon carbide (SiC) cellular ceramic skeletons based on ceramic pillars of 250 lm in diameter and porous micro-channels of 700 lm were used as support to grow long and aligned crystalline carboxyl functionalized carbon nanotubes (COx) by floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition. The resulting hybrid COx/SiC material retained water and allowed the flow of oils and gasoline through the specimen, showing, thus, superhydrophobic and superoleophilic properties. In addition, the developed hybrid material exhibited high electrical conductivity with a good ohmic contact at the COx-SiC interface. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Concentrated ceramic inks based on β-SiC powders, with different amounts of Y2O3 and Al2O3 as sintering aids, are developed for the adequate production of SiC scaffolds, with different patterned morphologies, by the Robocasting technique. The densifi cation of the as-produced 3D structures, previously heat treated in air at 600 °C for the organics burn-out, is achieved with a Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) furnace. The effects of the amount of sintering additives (7 - 20 wt. %) and the size of the SiC powders (50 nm and 0.5 μm) on the processing of the inks, microstructure, hardness and elastic modulus of the sintered scaffolds, are studied. The use of nano-sized β-SiC powders significantly restricts the attainable maximum solids volume fraction of the ink (0.32 compared to 0.44 of the submicron-sized powders-based ink), involving a much larger porosity of the green ceramic bodies. Furthermore, reduced amounts of additives improve the mechanical properties of the ceramic skeleton; particularly, the stiffness. The grain size and specific surface area of the starting powders, the ink solids content, green porosity, amount of sintering additives and SPS temperatures are the main parameters to be taken into account for the production of these SiC cellular ceramics.

ABSTRACT: Bone complexity demands the engineering of new scaffolding solutions for its reconstructive surgery. Emerging bone grafts should offer not only mechanical support but also functional properties to explore innovative bone therapies. Following this, ceramic bone grafts of Glass/hydroxyapatite (HA) reinforced with conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs) - CNT/Glass/HA - were prepared for bone electrotherapy purposes. Computer-aided 3D microstructural reconstructions and TEM analysis of CNT/Glass/HA composites provided details on the CNT 3D network and further correlation to their functional properties. CNTs are arranged as sub-micrometric sized ropes bridging homogenously distributed ellipsoid-shaped agglomerates. This arrangement yielded composites with a percolation threshold of pc = 1.5 vol.%. At 4.4 vol.% of CNTs, thermal and electrical conductivities of 1.5 W·m - 1·K- 1 and 55 S·m- 1, respectively, were obtained, matching relevant requisites in electrical stimulation protocols. While the former avoids bone damaging from Joule's heat generation, the latter might allow the confinement of external electrical fields through the conductive material if used for in vivo electrical stimulation. Moreover, the electrically conductive bone grafts have better mechanical properties than those of the natural cortical bone. Overall, these highly conductive materials with controlled size CNT agglomerates might accelerate bone bonding and maximize the delivery of electrical stimulation during electrotherapy practices. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The tribological properties of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs)/Si 3N4 composites are investigated for the first time using a reciprocating ball-on-plate configuration under isooctane lubrication. The role of these carbon nanostructures is studied through the analysis of the debris and wear tracks by micro-Raman spectroscopy. GNPs are excellent nanofillers for enhancing the tribological performance of ceramics. Under high contact pressures, GNPs are able to reduce friction and, especially, to increase the wear resistance up to 56% due to the exfoliation of the nanoplatelets that creates an adhered protective tribofilm. These composites are promising for their use in gasoline direct injection systems. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The outstanding electronic and physico-chemical properties of graphene make it an ideal filler in the fabrication of conducting and robust ceramic composites. In this study, a novel single-step approach for processing electrically conducting and well dispersed graphene/SiC nanocomposites is shown. These materials were processed by growing epitaxial graphene with either α- or β-phase SiC ceramics during their densification via spark plasma sintering (SPS). About 4. vol.% of few-layer graphene domains were generated in situ during the SPS process, leading to a conducting graphene network that significantly enhanced the electrical performance of SiC. The in situ graphene SPS growth mechanism arose from the combined action of the electric current, high temperature and partial vacuum. This approach offers unprecedented opportunities for the fast manufacturing of graphene/SiC nanocomposites with superior electrical and mechanical properties, precluding the handling of potentially hazardous nanostructures. This method widens their possible applications, including micro-electromechanical systems, brakes, micro-turbines or micro-rotors. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Graphene/silicon nitride (Si3N4) composites with high fraction of few layered graphene are synthesized by an in situ reduction of graphene oxide (GO) during spark plasma sintering (SPS) of the GO/Si 3N4 composites. The adequate intermixing of the GO layers and the ceramic powders is achieved in alcohol under sonication followed by blade mixing. The reduction of GO occurs together with the composite densification in SPS, thus avoiding the implementation of additional reduction steps. The materials are studied by X-ray photoelectron and micro-Raman spectroscopy, revealing a high level of recovery of graphene-like domains. The SPS graphene/Si3N4 composites exhibit relatively large electrical conductivity values caused by the presence of reduced graphene oxide (∼1 S cm-1 for ∼4 vol.%, and ∼7 S cm-1 for 7 vol.% of reduced-GO). This single-step process also prevents the formation of highly curved graphene sheets during the thermal treatment as the sheets are homogeneously embedded in the ceramic matrix. The uniform distribution of the reduced GO sheets in the composites also produces a noticeable grain refinement of the silicon nitride matrix. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Elasticity and internal friction of graphene nanoplatelets (3wt.%)/Si3N4 composite is analyzed by ultrasonic methods. It is shown that the composite exhibits a degenerate (elliptic) form of transversal isotropy with the graphene nanoplatelets acting effectively as spheroidal voids and inducing significant softening in all directions. The shear internal friction is strongly anisotropic with the maximal value corresponding to the volume-preserving, 'breathing' vibrations of the nanoplatelets. Possible relations between the observed behaviors and the micromorphology of the composite are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The miniaturization of mechanical components with complex shapes is a great challenge in emerging applications. Silicon nitride (Si3N 4) ceramics are excellent candidates for such applications due to their outstanding mechanical, thermal, and tribological properties. However, they are difficult to machine using normal mechanical machining methods. If the material were electrically conductive, electrical discharge machining (EDM) could be applied to produce precise and complex shapes. In this paper, in order to investigate the effects of electrical conductivity on the EDM characteristics, several carbon nanostructure composite materials are fabricated and EDMed using the assisting electrode method proposed by the current authors. The performance of the process is evaluated as a function of the carbon nanostructure content and type. The former is separately selected to be close to the electrical percolation threshold (0.9 vol.% and 5.3 vol.% for carbon nanotube (CNT) and graphene Nano platelet (GNP) composites, respectively), and well above that limit (5.3 vol.% and 20.6 vol.%), where electrical conductivities on the order of 10 and 100 S·m-1are attained for CNTs and GNPs-based nanocomposites, respectively. In addition, bare Si 3N4 specimens are also tested. Material removal rate, electrode wear ratio, and surface roughness of the machined pieces are analyzed for all testing conditions. © 2013 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Geometrically complex, three-dimensional (3-D) structures of SiC were produced by a colloidal printing method known as robocasting, followed by low-pressure spark plasma sintering (SPS) to produce dense ceramic bodies. A concentrated, aqueous colloidal ink consisting of SiC, Al 2O 3, and Y 2O 3 particles in a dilute polymer solution with a total solids volume fraction of 0.44 was developed to have pseudoplastic behavior with yield stress rheology. Lattice structures consisting of extruded filaments deposited in an overall cylindrical or cuboid shape were printed through nozzles ranging in diameter from 150 to 330 μm. After printing, drying and calcining processes, the structures were sintered at 1700°C in argon by SPS. The final average grain size was 1-2 μm and samples displayed above 97% of theoretical density, showing ∼22.8% linear shrinkage from green to sintered state. © 2012 The American Ceramic Society.

ABSTRACT: Silicon nitride (Si 3N 4) composites containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or graphene nanoplateles (GNPs) are of great relevance in the electronic and aerospace industries where the search for new materials with enhanced and anisotropic thermal conductivity to work in harsh environments is a strategic guideline. Here we study thermal conduction in Si 3N 4 composites with different amounts of carbon nanostructures. The effects of the nanostructure orientation respect the heat flux, the testing temperature and the α/β Si 3N 4 phase ratio are analyzed. The addition of CNTs and GNPs leads to an anisotropic thermal response, decreasing the through-thickness thermal conductivity of the Si 3N 4 composites and raising the in-plane thermal conductivity, especially for GNPs that enhance it up to twice that of the monolithic Si 3N 4. This effect is related to the preferred orientation of the nanostructures that gives a less resistive network in the in-plane direction and the intrinsic anisotropy of their thermal conductivity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The applicability of resonant ultrasound spectroscopy on materials with weak spatial gradients in elastic coefficients and density is analyzed. It is shown that such gradients do not affect measurably the resonant spectrum but have a significant impact on the modal shapes. A numerical inverse procedure is proposed to explore the possibility of reconstructing the gradients from experimentally obtained modal shapes. This procedure is tested on synthetic data and applied to determine the gradient of the shear modulus in a continuously graded silicon nitride ceramic material. The results are in a good agreement with the gradient calculated for the examined material theoretically as well as with the results of other experimental methods. © 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

ABSTRACT: The implementation of ceramics in emerging applications is principally limited by the final machining process necessary for producing microcomponents with complex geometries. The addition of carbon nanotubes greatly enhances the electrical properties of insulating ceramics allowing electrical discharge machining to be used to manufacture intricate parts. Meanwhile other properties of the ceramic may be either preserved or even improved. For the first time, a silicon nitride/carbon nanotubes microgear is electrically discharge machined with a remarkably high material removal rate, low surface roughness, and low tool wear. This offers unprecedented opportunities for the manufacture of complicated ceramic parts by adding carbon nanotubes for new engineering and biomedical applications. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The effect of the pulse peak voltage on the initial particle rearrangement stage of liquid-phase spark plasma sintering of silicon nitride is studied by varying the DC on:off pulse pattern. The shrinkage rate vs. temperature curves showed that the intensity and position of the rearrangement stage peak were dependent on the pulse peak voltage. An alternative sintering mechanism based on the electrowetting phenomenon is proposed to explain the experimental data. © 2011 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: In the search for materials that can withstand the new demanding tribological conditions, carbon nanotubes containing ceramic composites emerge as a promising alternative in gasoline direct injection systems. To explore this prospect, the tribological properties of dense good-dispersed multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) containing silicon nitride (Si3N 4) nanocomposites were investigated using a reciprocating ball-on-plate configuration mated against Si3N4 balls under lubrication with isooctane. The friction coefficient and the wear resistance of the materials were evaluated as a function of the MWCNTs content (up to 8.6 vol%) and the applied load (50-200 N). For the nanocomposites both the friction coefficient and the wear volume decreased in about 40% and 80%, respectively, as compared with the monolithic material. This enhanced tribological performance of the nanocomposites was attributed to the special role played by nanotubes, acting as solid lubricant and modifying, at the same time, the stress field distribution at the contact, thus notably enhancing the wear resistance at high loads. © 2011 The American Ceramic Society.

ABSTRACT: Silicon nitride ceramics with up to 8.6 vol.-% of carbon nanotubes (CNT) were tribologically characterized under unlubricated and media lubricated (isooctane, distilled water, ethanol) oscillating sliding conditions mated against Si 3N 4 balls. CNT composites didn't show an improved tribological performance under dry conditions compared to monolithic Si 3N 4. But under lubrication with isooctane the friction coefficient was decreased by about 40 % and also the volumetric wear of the ceramic plates was significantly reduced by the addition of CNTs.

ABSTRACT: Carbon nanotubes were synthesized on silicon nitride substrates by thermal chemical vapour deposition using an iron precursor catalyst. The nanotubes were characterized by AFM, FESEM, TEM and micro-Raman spectroscopy. The surface topography of the substrate, dense and flat or porous and rough, controlled the catalyst distribution and carbon nanotubes growth. Flat surfaces led to the synthesis of single-walled carbon nanotubes, whereas the porous ones promoted the growth of multi-walled carbon nanotubes of 60 nm diameter. These nanotubes preferentially grew on the porous sites, exhibiting a good substrate-nanotube interface. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The carbon nanotubes (CNTs) functionalization for developing ceramic matrix composites with an optimum interface between the matrix and nanotubes is presented. The functionalization processes were successfully performed by means of oxidation and boron nitride and silicon oxide coatings, which were characterized, among others, by O2/N2 adsorption- desorption method, micro-Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In all cases, the functionalized CNTs exhibited an enhanced thermal stability compared to the original nanotubes. Silicon nitride (Si3N4) nanocomposites having 5.3 vol% of multi-walled CNTs, both pristine and functionalized, were developed. Dense nanocomposites having well dispersed nanotubes were attained under all circumstances, although the nanocomposites containing the coated CNTs required the use of a dispersant agent to prevent nanotubes agglomeration. Besides, slightly higher sintering temperatures were needed to densify the composites containing the coated CNTs. A stronger mechanical interlocking between the matrix and the nanotubes was achieved by the functionalization processes, which led to some improvement of the mechanical properties of these nanocomposites, compared to those containing pristine CNTs; and actually values that were close or even higher than those measured for the blank Si 3N4 were achieved. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

ABSTRACT: Dense silicon nitride (Si3N4) composites with various amounts (0-8.6vol%) of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are electrically characterised by combining macroscopic dc-ac and nanoscale conductive scanning force microscopy (C-SFM) measurements. In this way, a coherent picture of the dominant charge transport mechanisms in Si3N4/MWCNTs composites is presented. A raise of more than 10 orders of magnitude in the electrical dc conductivity compared to the blank specimen is measured for MWCNTs contents above 0.9vol%. Semiconductor and metallic-like behaviours are observed depending on both the temperature and the MWCNTs content. Macroscopic measurements are further supported at the nanoscale by means of C-SFM. The metallic-type conduction is associated to charge transporting along the nanotube shells, whereas the semiconductor behaviour is linked to hopping conduction across nanotube-nanotube contacts and across intrinsic defect clusters within the nanotubes. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Densification evolution has been analysed in liquid phase assisted spark plasma sintering (SPS) of silicon nitride (Si3N4)-based materials. Monolithic ceramics with variable amounts of Al2O 3/Y2O3 sintering additives, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) containing Si3N4 composites have been considered. The shrinkage behaviour of SPSed monolithic Si3N 4 showed a noticeable enhancement of the particle rearrangement stage, exhibiting a complete wetting of the grain boundary phase even for the lowest additive content (1.70 vol.%), unlike the corresponding hot pressed (HPed) material. An improvement of the liquid phase wetting by the presence of electromechanical forces is proposed to explain the enhanced densification occurring in the particle rearrangement stage of the SPS process. Furthermore, the addition of CNTs seems to increase the efficiency of this mechanism, decreasing the particle rearrangement temperature. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

ABSTRACT: Several key topics on the current assisted sintering of Si3N4-based materials are reviewed. First, different proposed mechanisms for spark plasma sintered (SPSed) ceramics are presented, discussing the electric field effect on the liquid phase behaviour and how it may influence the liquid phase sintering of Si3N4 ceramics. Next, we show that the SPS is a powerful tool to develop new Si3N4-based materials with tailored microstructures, such as functionally graded materials (FGMs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) containing Si3N4 matrix composites. Si3N4 FGMs are fabricated from a sole homogenous Si3N4 mixture just modifying the SPS system punches set-up, thus creating a temperature gradient through the specimen. Finally, the capability of SPS to get dense Si3N4/CNTs composites overcoming both constraint densification and nanotubes degradation is proved. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The spark plasma sintering (SPS) of Si3N4 powders plus Al2O3 and Y2O3 sintering additives, added in variable amounts from 2.5 to 7 wt%, is reported for the range of temperatures 1500 1675°C. Same compositions hot pressed (HP) at higher temperatures (1600 1750°C) only give dense materials for the composite with 7 wt% of additives. For lower additive contents, full densification is only possible by SPS. The comparison between the shrinkage rate curves of SPS specimens and published data for conventionally sintered Si 3N4 of similar characteristics points out that an enhancement of the particle rearrangement stage by SPS occurs. A lack of homogeneity in the distribution of glassy phase is observed in the HP material with the lowest additive content, whereas the equivalent SPS material shows a completely wetting grain boundary phase. Based on these results, the role played by electrowetting in the first sintering stage of liquid phase sintering is signalled as responsible of the enhanced sintering rate.

ABSTRACT: Silicon nitride (Si 3N 4) materials with 1.8 and 5.3 vol.% of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were densified using 7 wt% of sintering additives (Y 2O 3+Al 2O 3). The mixing and sintering procedures produced quite homogenous and dense MWCNT/Si 3N 4 composites. The nanotubes condition was followed by micro-Raman spectroscopy and no alteration was observed in spite of the relatively high sintering temperatures (∼1600 °C). Mechanical parameters (hardness, elastic modulus and fracture toughness) of the composites and comparative blank specimens were measured by instrumented indentation and discussed in parallel. Thermal conductivity was also estimated for these specimens. The nanotube orientation effect inherent to pressure assisted sintering methods and the weak interfacial bond between nanotubes and Si 3N 4 are important factors to explain the mechanical and thermal behaviours of these composites.

ABSTRACT: Multi-walled carbon nanotubes were highly aggregated into ropes after their synthesis by chemical vapour deposition and, therefore, two different methods for disentangling the bundles of nanotubes were studied. One method compared the use of mild and vigorous mechanical treatments in ethanol and the other one employed dispersants in aqueous media. For comparison purposes and according to their different exfoliating behaviour, sodium dodecyl sulphate and gum arabic were selected as dispersants. The results evidenced that mechanical sonication was insufficient for disentangling the ropes, whereas, the combined action of mild sonication in an ultrasonic bath with the addition of gum arabic to an aqueous suspension containing nanotubes improved the exfoliating performance. Stable suspensions of unbundled multi-walled carbon nanotubes were obtained adding only 0.05 wt% of gum arabic with a dispersant/MWNTs concentration ratio of 0.25. These values corresponded to a reduction in the dispersant concentration between 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared to those commonly employed. In addition, a processing route for manufacturing dense and homogenous silicon nitride composites using spark plasma sintering with 1.8 vol% of multi-walled carbon nanotubes almost free of organics was developed without nanotubes degradation and aggregation. © 2009 American Scientific Publishers.

ABSTRACT: Functionally graded materials can enhance the performance of components under demanding operating conditions, although the development of residual stresses across the gradient and scaling up the manufacturing process to mass production present some limitations. To overcome these problems, we present a one-step approach for processing continuous functionally graded silicon nitride (Si3N4) materials from a sole homogeneous powder composition, using spark plasma sintering as a densification technique. Through the control of the temperature profile within the compact, specimens with a continuous variation of α- and β-phase content, as well as grain size, were achieved. A continuous gradation of mechanical properties, in particular, hardness and toughness, were measured in these specimens. This approach offers unprecedented opportunities to design custom-made Si3N4 components by taking advantage of the particularities of field-assisted sintering methods. © 2009 Acta Materialia Inc.

ABSTRACT: The wear behaviour of textured silicon nitride (Si3N4) ceramics with aligned microstructures was analyzed under abrasive wear conditions. Dry reciprocating self-mated ball-on-flat wear tests were performed to study the influence of different microstructural plane/orientation combinations on the Si3N4 tribological behaviour. Textured materials showed superior wear resistance than non-textured reference Si3N4 for the whole range of loads and contact pressures, 5-50 N and 1.7-3.6 GPa, respectively, with an increase of about 70% for the maximum applied load. Within textured materials, the plane perpendicular to the extruding direction exhibited a 50% higher wear resistance (4 × 10-5 mm3 N-1 m-1) than the parallel plane where the elongated grains were aligned. The severe wear process involved debonding, fracture and debris formation mechanisms. The progress of this sequence depended on the particular microstructure of each plane/orientation combination. A relationship between abrasive wear resistance and selected microstructural parameters has been established. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The manufacture of β-Si3N4 seeds by self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS) presents some advantages, such as the low production costs, compared to other preparation methods based on sintering of α-Si3N4 powders and subsequent leaching out of the glassy phase. However, SHS process produces seed clusters that must be disentangled before use as reinforcing particles. Different mechanical and chemical treatments were tried to achieve good seed dispersion, proving that a combined treatment based on a hot basic etching and a short time attrition milling gave almost agglomerate-free particles with adequate features for seeding use. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The effect of changing the Y2O3:Al2O3 additive ratio over grain growth of Si3N4 materials with and without β-seeds addition is studied. Increasing the amount of Al2O3 from 2 to 4 wt.% strongly affects grain growth in non-seeded materials whereas it hardly does in seeded ones. Results suggest that β-seeds addition changes the rate limiting step for the Si3N4 grain growth from diffusion to interfacial reaction. © 2007.

ABSTRACT: Aligned Si3N4 microstructures were achieved by seeding, extruding, and laminating methods. The degree of grain alignment was determined by microstructural measurements. Mechanical properties, including toughness, strength, hardness, and elastic modulus, as well as the contact damage response, were addressed and discussed as a function of this anisotropic microstructure. KIC values over 8 MPa · m1/2 and strengths above 900 MPa were achieved for the most favorable planes in the textured material. Contact damage behavior was influenced by grain orientation in two ways, first, by conferring elliptical shape to the radial surface cracks and second, by the multiple twin/slip formation at the large seeds within the high shear strain region. © 2007 The American Ceramic Society.

ABSTRACT: A study of microwave plasma (MPCVD) diamond deposition on Si3N4-TiN composites with different TiN amounts (0-30 vol.% TiN) is performed. These ceramic composites are requested in order to obtain a suitable material to be cut by electrodischarge machining (EDM), aiming their use as substrates for cutting tools and tribological components. TiN is an electrical conductor, contrarily to Si3N4, but it is characterized by a higher thermal expansion coefficient value than Si3N4 and diamond. The estimated thermal stresses are found to be low and tensile (0.90 GPa) when using the monolithic Si3N4 substrate, but compressive for the Si3N4-TiN composites, and even relatively high in magnitude (- 1.9 GPa) for the Si3N4-30 vol.% TiN composite. Brale indentation assessed the adhesion strength of diamond on the different substrate grades. Optimal behaviour (very low residual stress; no film delamination under 1000 N) is observed for the Si3N4-9 vol.% TiN substrate, corresponding to the lowest thermal mismatch and minimal residual stress magnitude. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Dense silicon nitride (Si3N4) composites containing 1 wt% of multi-wall carbon nanotubes were prepared by spark plasma sintering (SPS), showing a quite homogeneous dispersion of the nanotubes into the matrix without signs of degradation. Peak temperature, holding time, applied pressure and vacuum level were modified to analyze their effect on the microstructure of the materials. The composite sintered at 1500 °C had an 80 vol% α-Si3N4 phase without almost grain growth and showed the highest hardness (∼ 18 GPa) but the lowest fracture toughness (4.4 MPa·m1/2) values. An increase of 50 °C in the sintering temperature activated the α → β-Si3N4 phase transformation (60 vol % of β-phase) decreasing the hardness. The grain growth was promoted increasing the holding time at a given temperature, which caused higher fracture toughness due to the development of in-situ toughening mechanisms. MWNTs contributed to this toughening by the development of crack bridging effects.

ABSTRACT: Textured Si3N4 materials have been fabricated by extruding ceramic pastes, containing β-Si3N4 seeds, and later densification by hot-pressing. A strong anisotropy in the microstructure of the specimens was observed, which drastically influenced their properties. The thermomechanical and tribological behavior of the textured materials were investigated. The surface perpendicular to the Si 3N4 grain alignment presented higher wear resistance than the parallel one. The thermal conductivity of the material increased when the heat flux ran along the elongated Si3N4 grains.

ABSTRACT: The effect of the flame temperature on the microstructure of CaZrO3 flame sprayed coatings was investigated. Morphological aspects of the ceramic coatings were analysed in terms of splat characteristics, number of cracks/pores and texturing degree. Microhardness measurements were used to estimate the porosity in the coatings. The coating quality was correlated with the texturing degree by using the intensities ratio between selected XRD peaks (I(101)/I(121)) of the orthorhombic CaZrO3 phase. A thermal conductivity of 0.6 W m- 1 K- 1 was measured at 25 °C for a freestanding specimen with 12% of porosity, which confirms the potentiality of CaZrO3 coatings in thermal barrier applications. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Dry ceramic block-on-steel ring wear tests were performed at high loads in several Al2O3/20 vol.% SiC composites as a function of the SiC grain size, which ranged from 0.2 to 4.5 μm in d50. The wear resistance of the monolithic alumina was radically improved by the addition of the SiC particles, reducing down to one order of magnitude wear rate. Two different behaviours were identified according to the microstructural observations on the worm surfaces: intergranular fracture and grain pull-out in the monolithic Al2O3, and plastic deformation and surface polishing in the composites. The wear resistance of the Al2 O3/SiC composites increased with the SiC grain size due to their fracture toughness enhancement. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Friction and wear behaviour of self-mated chemical vapour deposited (CVD) diamond films coating silicon nitride ceramics (Si3 N4) were investigated in ambient atmosphere. The tribological tests were conducted in a reciprocal motion ball-on-flat type tribometer under applied normal loads up to 80 N (∼10 GPa). Several characterisation techniques - including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and micro-Raman studies - were used in order to assess the quality, stress state and wear resistance of the coatings. In addition, a novel method is presented to estimate the wear coefficient of the diamond coated flat specimens from AFM and optical microscopy (OM) observations of the wear tracks. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

ABSTRACT: In-situ measurements of acoustic emission (AE) in self-mated tribological pairs of CVD diamond coated silicon nitride (Si3N4) were made with the purpose of investigating the relationship between AE signal and friction events. A good correlation is found between the energy dissipation/emission processes, therefore enabling the possibility of monitoring the different friction regimes occurring during the sliding contact of microcrystalline diamond (MCD) coatings. Deposition of MCD on flat and ball-shaped Si3N4 samples was accomplished using microwave plasma assisted chemical vapour deposition (MPCVD) with H2/CH 4 gas mixtures. The friction behaviour of self-mated MCD coatings was assessed using a reciprocating ball-on-flat geometry. The tests were run in ambient atmosphere without lubrication, the frequency (1Hz) and stroke (6mm) were kept constant while the applied normal load varied in the range 10-80N. The microstructure, surface topography and roughness of the MCD coatings were characterised by SEM and AFM techniques. The diamond quality was assessed from micro-Raman spectroscopy. The friction evolution was characterised by a short running-in period where the main feature is a sharp peak reaching values as high as approximately 0.6 followed by a steady-state regime with very low values in the range 0.03-0.04.

ABSTRACT: Chemical vapour deposited (CVD) diamond coatings are important for tribological applications due to their unique combination of properties. Previous work demonstrated that silicon nitride (Si3N4) excels as a substrate for diamond coatings due to its low thermal expansion coefficient mismatch relative to diamond films resulting in a significant adhesion improvement. In this study, dense Si3N4 substrates were fabricated by pressureless sintering and diamond coated by microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition (MPCVD). The deposition time varied between 1 and 10 h in order to investigate the effect of the diamond grain size and film thickness on the tribological behaviour of self-mated CVD diamond coatings on Si3N4. Reciprocating dry sliding ball-on-flat (BOF) wear tests were performed in air up to 16 h, at room temperature, with normal applied load ranging from 10 to 105 N. The stroke and frequency of the sliding motion were kept constant with values of 6 mm and 1 Hz, respectively. Several characterisation techniques (scanning electron microscope (SEM), atomic force microscope (AFM), micro-Raman) were used to identify the prevailing surface damage mechanisms. After a very short running-in regime, with high friction coefficients, a steady-state regime is reached, characterized by extremely low friction values (μ ∼ 0.03). A mild wear mode was achieved for the longer runs, with wear coefficient values around 10-8 mm 3 N-1 m-1. The larger grain sized and thicker coatings present smaller compressive residual stresses (below 1 GPa) due to a better in-depth accommodation of the contact pressure. This delays film delamination to much higher applied loads (105 N) than the thinner, small grain sized coatings, grown for 1 h that fail in sliding under 35 N of normal load. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The effect of Si3N4 secondary phases on chemical vapour deposition (CVD) diamond film growth was analyzed. Silicon nitride substrates were obtained by pressureless sintering, placing the green samples inside a powder bed of Si3N4/BN. Local variations in the sintering atmosphere led to samples with different grey colouration as well as chemical and physical characteristics, determined by X-ray diffraction and thermal conductivity tests, which affected the diamond film growth. A complete characterization of the films, including thickness, average crystal size, surface roughness, texture and adhesion, was done. The Si3N 4 substrate with glassier phase gave thicker diamond films, with smaller crystal sizes and better film adhesion to the substrate than the diamond films grown on ceramic substrates with less vitreous phase. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The cutting forces evolution is investigated during the dry turning of sintered hardmetal (WC-25 wt.%Co) with chemical vapour deposition (CVD) diamond brazed tools. The effect of the cutting speed (v), feed (f) and depth of cut (d) in the cutting forces is analysed, being found a clear relationship between tool forces, tool wear and workpiece surface finishing. The chosen test conditions (v = 40 m min-1, f = 0.03 mm rev.-1 and d = 0.1 mm) allow to set up a threshold main cutting force value of 35 N below which excellent workpiece finishing is assured with low cutting tool damage. Flank tool wear, besides cratering on the rake tool face and hardmetal deposition on the tool surface, are the main damage modes of the cutting tools. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Silicon nitride substrates have been diamond coated by hot-filament (home made) and microwave plasma (commercial) CVD reactors. The importance of Si 3N4 as substrate relies on its favoured adhesion to the diamond film, as required in wear applications. Diamond coatings have been characterized by μ-Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The diamond film/substrate adhesion has been evaluated by performing Brale indentations at different loads. The diamond films grown by hot filament matched those grown by microwave plasma in terms of morphology and diamond quality, only loosing in uniformity. Spherical substrates have also been used to compare the films coated by both techniques.

ABSTRACT: Carbon fibre reinforced carbon composites were turned using uncoated and CVD diamond coated Si3N4 cutting tools. Si 3N4 inserts were fabricated by pressureless sintering and some of them were coated with a 2.5μm thick diamond film produced by hot filament chemical vapour deposition. The cutting forces and the tool wear behaviour were investigated as a function of the cutting speed (v = from 2.5 to 10 m·s-1). The cutting forces were recorded and the final tool damage was evaluated by optical and scanning electron microscopy observations. The turning tests performed with the uncoated tips show that the cutting forces notably increase with the cutting speed and the cutting length. Severe wear of the tool flank face takes place due to rubbing by the abrasive carbon powder generated during the turning operation, the tool wear increasing with the cutting speed. Conversely, CVD diamond coated Si3N4 tips exhibit low and constant cutting forces at the different cutting parameters, due to the formation of a carbon lubricant layer. The existence of this layer and the outstanding diamond hardness anticipates the use of CVD diamond coated materials for the high speed machining of CFRC composites.

ABSTRACT: The performance of the Nd:YAG laser to cut thick (500 μm) free standing CVD diamond films for electronic, optical and mechanical applications, is investigated. A pulsed Nd:YAG laser at a wavelength of 1064 nm was employed. The cutting parameters varied within the following ranges: pulse energy = 0.8-4.6 J; pulse width = 0.3-1.0 ms; cutting speed = 5-10 mm·s-1; frequency = 100-500 Hz. The structural and morphological modification of the cutting surface was evaluated by optical and electron microscopy, and micro-Raman spectroscopy. A minimum energy density of 50 kJ·cm -3 is required to get complete cuts. The columnar morphology of the CVD diamond films leads to a high heat dissipation along the normal direction to the diamond surface. This effect allows a limited amorphized area, which allows cutting at high speeds up to 15 mm·s-1. The best cutting configuration is to impinge the laser on the nucleation side of the freestanding plate, due to the favourable thermal conductivity gradient. The high flexibility of this type of laser, given by the possibility to guide the laser beam by means of an optical fibre allows the automation of the diamond cutting process.

ABSTRACT: The overall residual stresses and the stress distribution on chemical vapor deposition diamond coated silicon nitride were studied. The stresses were investigated using the classical sin2 ψ method and the low incident beam angle diffraction technique. It was found that the stress profile along the film thickness exhibited a linear decrease from a compressive residual stress of -3.7 GPa in the upper layer of the film to almost zero stress at the film/substrate interface.

ABSTRACT: The thermal conductivity of hot-pressed Al2O3/SiC platelet composites is determined as a function of the platelet content, from 0 to 30 vol.% of SiC. Existing heat conduction models are employed to discuss the experimental data. Data agree with the presence of an interfacial thermal resistance at the Al2O3/SiC grain boundaries, which precludes the effect of percolation on the thermal conductivity for the higher percentage of SiC platelets. The observed orientation effect on the thermal conductivity due to an alignment of the platelets is also modelled using the Hasselman's approach. The thermal conductivity of the SiC platelets is calculated from the effective thermal conductivity of the composites. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Sintered hardmetals are very hard materials that are usually machined using diamond grinding wheels and electro-discharge machining. Dry cutting with super-hard cutting tools like cubic boron nitride (c-BN), polycrystalline diamond (PCD) and chemical vapour deposition (CVD) diamond is an ecological alternative to reduce operation times and, therefore, to improve the productivity. In the present work, cylindrical forging dies of WC-27 wt.% Co hardmetal grade were turned at fixed operating parameters (cutting speed=15 m/min; depth-of-cut=0.2 mm; feed rate=0.03 mm/rev.) using CVD diamond tipped hardmetal inserts. Commercial PCD and c-BN inserts were tested for comparison. The cutting tool behaviour was studied in terms of both the tool wear and the finishing quality of the workpiece. The tool damage was evaluated using a special probe for edge roughness evaluation, together with scanning electron microscopy observations. The CVD diamond tools survived the task showing slight cratering, whereas flank wear was the main wear mode for the other superhard tools. Amongst all the tested tools, PCD presented the worst performance in terms of tool wear and workpiece surface quality. Furthermore, the operation time was reduced to one tenth with respect to conventional diamond wheel grinding. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The objective of this work is to study the performance of the Nd:YAG laser to cut thick free standing CVD diamond films. The high flexibility of this type of laser, given by the possibility to guide the laser beam by means of an optical fibre represents a great advantage in order to automate the cutting process in the production lines. Laser cutting technology is imperative to shape non-conductive CVD diamond parts for electronic, optical and mechanical applications, namely heat sinks, infrared transparent windows and small tips to braze onto machining tool holders. Concerning diamond tool production, the rapid cutting method by laser here proposed provides an advantage to CVD diamond when compared to conventional polycrystalline diamond (PCD) blanks that are cut by the Electro-Discharge Machining (EDM), a time-consuming and very expensive technique due to the electrodes cost. Free-standing diamond films were grown on silicon wafers by microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition (MPCVD) method in a ASTeX PDS 18 unit. The diamond growth parameters were: microwave power 4.35kW; total pressure 110Torr; H2 flow 400s.c.c.m.; CH4 flow 30s.c.c.m; deposition time 70h. The final film thickness was approximately 500μm. The diamond plates were then released by chemical dissolution of the Si substrate in a nitric/hydrofluoric acids mixture. The equipment employed to perform the cutting experiments consisted of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser delivering a maximum average power of 500W at a wavelength of 1064 nm. The laser beam was coupled to an optical fibre of 400μm diameter and 10 m long. The pulsed beam coming out of the fibre was focused onto the surface of the free standing diamond coating by means of a commercial cutting head, having a lens of 80 mm focal length, in which the laser beam was coaxial to the Ar gas jet used as assist gas. In this paper we discuss the results of the work carried out to analyse the influence on cuts quality of laser processing parameters such as: cutting speed 5-20mm/s; pulse width 0.3-1ms; pulse energy 0.8-4.6J; power 80-470W. Scanning electron microscopy was used to look into film cracking events and to appraise the cut width and linearity. Micro-Raman spectroscopy allowed the evaluation of the graphitisation level on the cut surface.

ABSTRACT: A review is presented of chemical vapour deposition (CVD) diamond coating of silicon nitride (Si3N4) materials. Microcrystalline and nanocrystalline diamond films were grown using microwave plasma (MPCVD) and hot filament (HFCVD) reactors, respectively. Scanning electron and atomic force microscopy, μ-Raman spectroscopy, low incident angle and classical X-ray diffraction, acoustic emission assisted Brale indentation and thermal conductivity measurements were employed for the full characterisation of the diamond/ Si3N4 system. Using these techniques, the nucleation and growth stages as a function of substrate composition and surface pretreatment were characterised, as well as the diamond quality, the existence of residual stresses and the adhesion between the diamond film and the substrate. Based on this study, a tailored material was developed and tested in the machining of hardmetal workpieces with encouraging results. © 2003 IoM Communications Ltd.

ABSTRACT: A modified macro-indentation technique was employed in order to establish the adhesion strength of chemical vapour deposited diamond coated silicon. For this purpose, a diamond Brale tip indenter was adapted to a universal testing machine coupled to a piezoelectric transducer for recording the acoustic emission (AE) signal of the cracking events. Post scanning electron microscope observations were a complementary tool to infer the cracking mechanisms and to assess the interfacial cracking resistance from crack dimensions. The AE plots showed that the silicon substrate is the source of most of the acoustic peaks detected on the diamond coated materials. Moreover, the acoustic signal increases with load as a result of the lateral and radial cracking arising. Two different diamond film thicknesses were compared to study the effect on adhesion. The thicker 40 μm diamond film exhibited a better adhesion than the 10 μm one based on the absence of delamination and on a higher interfacial cracking resistance (1650 and 350 kN m-1, respectively). © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: Acoustic emission (AE) from cracking events in microwave plasma assisted chemical vapour deposition diamond coated Si3N4 ceramics during Brale indentation tests was investigated. The experiments were conducted in a modified macro-indentation technique, that avoids the discrete loading limitation of conventional indentation by using a constant indenter displacement rate. The recorded AE signals, in conjunction with scanning electron microscope post-observations of the cracking pattern, allowed the adhesion behaviour investigation of the diamond film/ceramic system. The AE graphs evidenced that the most intensive acoustic peaks arise when film spalling takes place. The Si3N4 surface roughness was used as a variable to confirm the feasibility of the method. A better adhesion performance was achieved for the substrate with a higher roughness. For the diamond coated as-ground substrate the critical load for film detachment is ∼1000 N, while the film adhesion on the coated polished material is weaker. The assessment of the interfacial cracking resistance of the films gives a maximum value of 1372 kN m-1. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The efficiency of different surface pretreatments (four standard chemical etchings and four diamond powder abrasive procedures) on silicon nitride (Si3N4) substrates for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of diamond has been systematically investigated. Blank Si3N4 samples were polished with colloidal silica (∼0.25 μm). Diamond nucleation and growth runs were conducted in a microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition apparatus for 10 min and 6 h, respectively. Superior results concerning nucleation density (Nd ∼ 1010 cm-2 after 10 min), film uniformity, and grain size (below 2 μm after 6 h) were obtained for the mechanically microflawed samples, revealing that chemical etchings (hot and cold strong acids, molten base or CF4 plasma) are not crucial for good CVD diamond quality on Si3N4.

ABSTRACT: Al2O3/SiC-platelet composites have been obtained by three different sintering routes: pressureless sintering, gas pressure sintering and hot pressing. The effect of sintering conditions on the densification and microstructure of the composites has been evaluated. For the compacts obtained by hot pressing, relative densities close to theoretical have been achieved at temperatures 200-300°C lower than that used to sinter Al2O3/SiC-whisker composites. This technique produced anisotropic composites where the platelet basal plane was slightly perpendicular to the hot pressing axis. Gas pressure sintering has been proved to be an alternative to hot pressing for developing high-density near-net-shape Al2O3/SiC-platelet components with SiC contents up to 12 vol%. © 1996 Elsevier Science Limited.

ABSTRACT: Wear behaviour of Al2O3-SiC platelet composites has been analysed as a function of the content and the orientation of the platelets, The results have shown that wear volume increased with platelet content. For long sliding times (≥ 60 min) and high SiC platelet additions (≥ 12 vol.%), a mild-severe wear transition took place. A mechanism based on the triboelectrification concept has been developed to explain the wear behaviour of Al2O3-SiC platelet composites. A strongly anisotropic wear behaviour, that has been directly associated to the anisotropy in the electrical and mechanical responses, was observed. This behaviour was a consequence of the platelet orientation during hot pressing.

ABSTRACT: Mechanical behavior of hot-pressed SiC platelet reinforced alumina composites has been analyzed as a function of SiC platelet content for two different alumina matrix powders. Fracture toughness and flexural strength at temperatures ranging from 25 to 1200°C, R-curve behavior, and thermal shock resistance have been determined. Small differences in the impurity content of the starting Al2O3 powders strongly determine the microstructure and the mechanical behavior of Al2O3/SiC-platelet composites. Low alkali content alumina led to composites with large matrix grain size which presented spontaneous microcracking. At high temperature, a high viscosity liquid phase is formed that shields cracks enhancing mechanical properties and R-curve behavior. A small amount of impurities reduced Al2O3 matrix grain size and avoided spontaneous microcracking. Enhanced fracture toughness (up to 30%) at room temperature, R-curve behavior, and thermal shock resistance were achieved for these materials.

ABSTRACT: The sintering behavior of an Al2O3 compact containing uniformly dispersed Al2O3 platelets has been investigated. The results reveal a significant decrease in the sintering rate as well as the formation of voids and cracklike defects in the presence of nonsinterable platelets. The addition of a small amount (2 vol%) of tetragonal‐ZrO2 particles enhances the sintering rate, increases end‐point density (∼99.5% of theoretical density) and prevents formation of sintering defects.

ABSTRACT: The rheological behaviour of alumina/platelets (Al2O3 or SiC) suspensions has been established by measuring zeta potential versus pH and the relative viscosity as a function of pH, solids loading and platelets content. Highly homogeneous mixtures of alumina/platelets, with different platelets content (5, 8, 12 and 20 vol %), have been obtained by controlled flocculation at a pH value in the range 6-7. From these powders, very close to theoretical density (≥ 99% dth) and slightly oriented platelet-reinforced alumina compacts have been obtained by hot pressing at temperatures ranging from 1500-1550 °C. © 1994 Chapman &amp; Hall.

ABSTRACT: Al2O3 and Al2O3ZrO2 compacts containing CaO as a dopant have been sintered under different conditions and atmospheres: air, high vacuum (&gt;10-6 torr). SEM observations have been made on the polished surfaces of sintered and also of annealed samples. Only after the annealing treatment in air at temperatures ranging from 1400° to 1500°C, a massive formation of Ca6 platelets was detected in samples sintered in low oxygen partial pressure atmospheres. In order to clarify the mechanism of formation of this secondary phase at the grain boundaries. CaO has been introduced in the form of either plaster of Paris (to reproduce a possible contamination provided by the molds in slip casting) or CaCO3. The obtained results indicate the important role of the firing atmosphere on the precipitation of secondary phases at grain boundary.
